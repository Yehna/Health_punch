neural gaze june,device domain mismatch issue is an important problem of acoustic scene classification for to leverage this we focus on the knowledge transfer of the inner structural relationships between each a label embedding with relational teacher student learning approach is embedded labels are learned from the source domain which encodes the structural then a relational teacher student learning framework is used to transfer our proposed approach is evaluated on data and the experimental and visualized results successfully verify our augment and proposed which significantly improve the classification accuracy on target device with the knowledge transferred from the source device alternative this we use a model adaptation approach based on neural label embedding and knowledge distillation to combat the accuracy drop in acoustic scene classification with deep neural networks caused by a mismatch between development and production audio recording the proposed adaptation approach works with unpaired data and leverages upon nle designed to take into account the relationships among acoustic scene the nle thereby not only condenses a representation of the dnn output distribution given all audio recordings aligned with the same output class but also captures the inherent relationships among acoustic scene device adaptation is carried out using relational learning solely based on target target source and the latter serve as soft targets for dnn the proposed approach is assessed against the dcase experimental evidence confirm the effectiveness our our which compares favourably to conventional device and traditional based we observe that nle based on structural information lead to superior asc results than nle obtained with symmetric divergence do not take into account the relationships among acoustic scene alternative in this we propose a domain adaptation framework to address the device mismatch issue in acoustic scene classification leveraging upon neural label embedding and relational teacher student learning taking into account the structural relationships between acoustic scene our proposed framework captures such relationships which are intrinsically in the training transferable knowledge is condensed in nle from the source next in the adaptation a novel rtsl strategy is adopted to learn adapted target models without using paired data often required in conventional teacher student the proposed framework is evaluated on the dcase data experimental results based on deep classification models confirm the effectiveness of our proposed approach for mismatch training with device a data and testing with data recorded with devices b and adaptation compares favourably with the conventional device adaptation and teacher student

lives and culture has given rise to fast and easier access to the flow of information than ever in human the inherently unsupervised nature of social media platforms has also made it easier to spread false information and fake the high volume and velocity of information flow in such platforms make manual supervision and control of information propagation this paper aims to address this issue by proposing a novel deep learning approach for automated detection of false claims on social we first introduce sentimental which extends the liar dataset of short claims by adding features based on sentiment and emotion analysis of we propose a novel deep learning architecture based on the language model for classification of claims as genuine or our results demonstrate that the proposed architecture trained on sentimental liar can achieve an accuracy of which is an improvement of over previously reported results for the liar the previously reported accuracy of the task by focusing on the prevalent format of claims on social media such as our work to an unprecedented challenge in fake news is not only threatening to undermine democracy but equally has been proven to cause and chaos

on the benchmark datasets of multiple tasks including sentiment text classification and natural language experimental results demonstrate that our model consistently achieves both better attack performance and higher efficiency than recently proposed baseline we also find our attack model can bring more robustness improvement to the victim model by adversarial all the code and data of this paper will be made

long memory this we quantify and control the timescale of each unit in a lstm language model via the the input and forget gate distribution of timescales is selected to approximate power law statistics of natural language through a combination of exponentially decaying memory then design a prior based on statistical properties of natural language and construct a lstm language then empirically analyze the timescale of information routed through each part of the model using word ablation experiments and forget gate we propose word ablation experiments and forget gate visualizations to interpret the timescale of information routing through the different parts of a experiments show that the model successfully learns representations at the desired and that the

different random seeds,with the growth of online recruitment matching has become an important task to automatically match jobs with suitable this task is typically casted as a supervised text matching supervised learning is powerful when the labeled data is on online recruitment interaction data is sparse and which affects the performance of match task is typically casted as a supervised text matching supervised learning is powerful when the labeled data is sufficient and the interaction in practice is usually sparse and which brings difficulties to effective text representation to alleviate these in this we propose a novel network from sparse interaction data for our network consists of two major namely matching model and matching the two parts capture semantic compatibility in two different and complement each in order to address the challenges from sparse and noisy we design two specific strategies to combine the two two components share the learned parameters or so that the original representations of each component can be more we adopt a mechanism to reduce the influence of noise in training the core idea is to let the two components help each other by selecting more reliable training the two strategies focus on representation enhancement and data compared with pure matching the proposed approach is able to learn better data representations from limited or even sparse interaction which is more resistible to noise in training experiment results have demonstrated that our model is able to outperform methods for such a compared with pure match the proposed approach is able to learn better representations from limited or even sparse interaction and is more resistible to noise in training

we hope results provide valuable insights future work transfer learning practical applications languages unseen,problem importance data programming is a programmatic weak supervision approach to efficiently curate labeled training writing data programs both programming literacy and domain many subject matter experts have neither programming proficiency nor time to effectively write data regardless of one expertise in coding or machine transferring domain expertise into labeling functions by enumerating rules and thresholds is not only time consuming but also inherently proposed solution here we propose a new data programming by demonstration to generate labeling rules using interactive demonstrations of dpbd aims to relieve the burden of writing labeling functions from enabling them to focus on semantics such as identifying relevant signals for labeling we operationalize our framework with an interactive system that synthesizes labeling rules for document classification by using annotations of users on document evidence that it works we compare with conventional data programming through a user study conducted with data scientists creating labeling functions for sentiment and spam classification we find that is easier to use and learn and offers higher overall while providing discriminative model performances comparable to ones achieved by conventional data

rate causes the wider frequency band and longer waveform sequences and throws challenges for singing modeling in both frequency and time domains in singing voice synthesis conventional svs systems that adopt moderate sampling rate cannot well address the above in this we develop an svs system towards singing voice using sampling hifisinger consists of a fastspeech based neural acoustic model and a parallel wavegan based neural vocoder to ensure fast training and inference and also high voice to tackle the difficulty of singing modeling caused by high sampling rate we introduce adversarial training in both the acoustic model and vocoder to improve singing to handle the larger range of frequencies caused by higher sampling rate we propose a novel gan on which splits the full into multiple and models each with a separate to model longer waveform sequences caused by higher sampling we propose a gan for waveform generation to model different lengths of waveform sequences with separate we also introduce several additional designs and findings in hifisinger that are crucial for such as adding and as acoustic choosing an appropriate size for and increasing the receptive field in vocoder for long vowel modeling in singing experiment results show that hifisinger synthesizes singing voices with much higher mos gain over baseline and mos gain over previous svs audio samples

a significant effect on society in many ways by promoting racial hatred and white supremacist hate speech is one of the most recently observed harmful content on social traditional channels of reporting hate speech have proved inadequate due to the tremendous explosion of and it is necessary to find an automatic way to detect such speech in a timely this research investigates the viability of automatically detecting white supremacist hate speech on twitter by using deep learning and natural language processing through our we used two the first approach is by using embeddings which are extracted from white supremacist corpus in order to catch the meaning of this white supremacist slang with bidirectional long memory deep learning this approach reached a the second approach is by

discussed in since a sentence usually discusses one or more aspect categories and expresses different sentiments toward various methods have been developed to allocate the appropriate sentiment words for the given aspect category and obtain promising most of these methods directly use the given aspect category to find the aspect sentiment which may cause mismatching between the sentiment words and the aspect categories when an unrelated sentiment word is semantically meaningful for the given aspect to mitigate this we propose a sentence network for sentiment scan contains two graph attention modules and an interactive loss the graph attention modules generate representations of the nodes in sentence constituency parse trees for the aspect category detection task and the acsa acd aims to detect aspect categories discussed in sentences and is a auxiliary for a given aspect the interactive loss function helps the acd task to find the nodes which can predict the aspect category but can     predict other aspect the sentiment words in the nodes then are used to predict the sentiment polarity of the aspect category by the acsa the experimental results on five public datasets demonstrate

diverse such as computer natural language and speech the processes of these models are generally not interpretable to in various such as or it is critical to know the reasons behind a decision made by an artificial intelligence several directions for explaining neural models have recently been in this i investigate two major directions for explaining deep neural the first direction consists of explanatory that methods that aim to explain an already trained and fixed model and that provide explanations in terms of input such as tokens for text and superpixels for images the second direction consists of neural models that generate natural language that models that have a module that generates explanations for the predictions of the the contributions in these directions are as in this i investigate the topic of explaining deep neural this topic is crucial nowadays as neural model are becoming more and more employed in applications due to their high performance in diverse such as computer natural language and speech the processes learned by these models are not generally in various such as or criminal it is critical to know the reasons behind a decision made by an artificial intelligence several directions for explaining neural models have recently been a series of methods have recently been developed to provide explanations for the predictions of neural this thesis brings contributions to two major directions for explaining deep neural explanatory methods and neural models that generate natural language explanations for their the contributions are as it is still an open question how to verify whether the explanations provided by these methods are faithfully describing the processes of the models that they aim to it is also an open question whether neural networks can learn from natural language explanations for the labels at training as well as support their predictions with natural language explanations at test just like humans i reveal certain difficulties of explaining even trivial models using only input i show despite the apparent implicit assumption that explanatory methods should look for one specific there is often more than one such explanation for a i also show that two prevalent classes of explanatory methods target different types of explanations without explicitly mentioning i show neither of these explanations is enough to provide a complete view of a process on an findings can have an important impact on how users choose explanatory methods to best suit their i introduce a framework for automatically verifying the faithfulness with which explanatory methods describe the processes of the models that they aim to this framework relies on the use of a particular type of model that is expected to provide insight into its i analyse potential limitations of this approach and introduce ways to alleviate the introduced verification framework is generic and can be instantiated on different tasks and domains to provide sanity tests that can be used to test explanatory i instantiate this framework on a task of sentiment analysis and provide sanity sanity tests are available at test any explanatory on which i present the performances of three popular explanatory results show that these methods may provide unfaithful also discuss ways in which the current limitations of the framework can further be addressed to lead to more robust and flexible the process of developing this i uncover several ways in which a particular type of model that is expected to provide insight into its process can provide misleading such i also introduce checks that can be done to account for this misleading insight in order to use this type of model in the proposed before framework is generic and can be instantiated on different tasks and i instantiate it on a task of sentiment analysis and provide sanity tests that can be used tests are available at to test any explanatory i present preliminary results of three explanatory methods on these which raise awareness of the unfaithful explanations that these methods may discuss ways in which the limitations of this verification framework can further be addressed and open the path towards more robust and flexible verification frameworks that can be adapted to this framework relies on the use of a particular type of model that is expected to provide insight into its i analyse the potential limitations of this approach and introduce ways to overcome by constructions as a step towards addressing the question of verifying if explanatory methods faithfully describe the processes learned by the models they aim to i investigate a particular type of neural model and i show three ways in which this type of model can provide misleading on its i present a novel verification framework that can generate a multitude of sanity tests for explanatory i instantiate this framework on the task of sentiment analysis and provide three sanity which can be used tests are available at i present the results of three explanatory methods on these i discuss ways in which the limitations of this verification framework can further be addressed and open the path towards more robust and flexible verification frameworks that can be adapted to improve their behaviour and performance improved behaviour if they are additionally given natural language explanations for the label at training time to explore the direction of neural models that generate natural language explanations for their i collected a large dataset of natural language explanations on top of the influential stanford natural language inference i call this dataset dataset is publicly available at which i release dataset is available at advance research in the direction of training with and generation of natural language i provide empirical evidence that models generating correct explanations are more reliable than models that just predict the correct i also train different neural models that generate natural language explanations at test and i measure the success of these models to generate correct i also investigate whether the presence of natural language explanations at training time can lead a model to produce better universal sentence representations and to perform better on i do a series of experiments that investigate both the capabilities of neural models to generate correct natural language explanations at test and the benefits of providing natural language explanations at training i show that current models that generate natural language explanations for their own predictions may generate inconsistent such as is a dog in the and is no dog in the inconsistent explanations reveal either that the explanations are not faithfully describing the process of the model or that the model learned a flawed i introduce a simple yet effective adversarial framework for sanity checking models against the generation of inconsistent natural language as part of the i address the problem of adversarial attacks with exact target a scenario that was not previously addressed in and which can be useful for other tasks in natural language i apply the framework on a state of the art neural model on and show that this model can generate a significant number of this work paves the way for obtaining more robust neural models accompanied by faithful explanations for their hope is that in the future explanatory methods will be superseded by robust and accurate neural models that faithfully explain themselves to their human users in natural

they highly rely on labeled obtaining labeled is prohibitively expensive in many we study the problem of learning neural text classifiers without using any labeled but only rules as multiple weak supervision this problem is challenging because weak labels are often noisy and to address these two we design a label which estimates the source reliability using a conditional soft attention mechanism and then reduces label noise by aggregating weak the denoised pseudo labels then supervise a neural classifier to predicts soft labels for unmatched which address the rule coverage to address these we propose an model with two key components sentence is not informative need to deliver the key idea of our method in one sentence and then use the remaining sentences to elaborate our the first component is a rule which estimates conditional source reliability using a soft attention mechanism and reduces label noise by aggregating weak the second is a neural classifier that predicts soft labels for unmatchable samples to address the rule coverage two components are integrated into a which can be trained to mutually enhance each we evaluate our model on five benchmarks for and relation the results show that our model outperforms and methods and achieves comparable performance with methods even without any labeled our code can be found at

ideal avenue for the application of machine they are vital to many fields of science and but are very and require yet the three main stages of a systematic review are easily done searching for documents can be done via apis and selection of relevant documents can be done via binary and extraction of data can be done via despite the promise of automation for this little research exists that examines the various ways to automate each of these we construct a pipeline that automates each of these and experiment with many system quality we test the ability of classifiers to work well on small amounts of data and to generalise to data from countries not represented in the training we test different types of data extraction with varying difficulty in and five different neural architectures to do the we find that we can get surprising accuracy and generalisability of the whole pipeline system with only weeks of which is only of the time it takes to do the whole review manually and can be repeated and extended to new data with no additional and links to models available at

approaches to this problem seek to control gender inflection in the target language by explicitly or implicitly adding a gender feature to the source usually at the sentence in this paper we propose schemes for incorporating explicit gender inflection tags into we explore the potential of this controlled translation when the gender feature can be determined from a human or when a test sentence

commonsense knowledge bases and comprehensive ways to capture precision and we show how commonsense kgs provide a clear vehicle to access knowledge in recent years have brought about a renewed interest in commonsense representation and reasoning in the field of natural language the development of new commonsense knowledge graphs has been central to these advances as their diverse facts can be used and referenced by machine learning models for tackling new and challenging at the same there remain questions about the quality and coverage of these resources due to the massive scale required to comprehensively encompass general commonsense in this we posit that manually constructed cskgs will never achieve the coverage necessary to be applicable in all situations encountered by nlp we propose a new evaluation framework for testing the utility of kgs based on how effectively implicit knowledge representations can be learned from with this new we propose a new cskg of commonsense knowledge containing knowledge that is not readily available in pretrained language we evaluate its properties in comparison with other leading performing the first pairwise study of commonsense knowledge we show that is better suited for training knowledge models that can generate representative knowledge for unseen entities and through human we show that the performance of while remains absolute points lower than a knowledge model trained on despite using over fewer useful they are for training knowledge models that can generate relevant representative knowledge for unseen in this we propose a new knowledge graph of commonsense knowledge to evaluate its utility in comparison to existing we perform the first pairwise study of commonsense knowledge graphs on coverage and we posit that a new use for commonsense knowledge graphs is their ability to allow language models to learn to represent knowledge we propose a new evaluation for testing knowledge graphs on how useful they are for training knowledge models that can generate relevant representative knowledge for unseen

works do not fully address the sparse relationships between entities and which loses this important information and thus deteriorates the extraction to mitigate this we first define the as a labeling task with a tag set composed of tags of triggers and to incorporate the missing information in the aforementioned we propose a to alternately supervise the extraction of either triggers or entities based on the type distribution of each since the connected entities and triggers naturally form a heterogeneous information network we leverage the latent pattern along for a given corpus to further improve the performance of our proposed to verify the effectiveness of our proposed we conduct extensive experiments on four datasets as well as compare our method with empirical results and analysis

extensive experiments show modules work effectively generating topical taxonomy based for future interesting study generate taxonomy concept node described terms different aspects though terms captured concept learning recognize organize meaningful clusters remains challenging worth,think that the current version is too detailed and does not position the work at it just says what is being here is a understanding natural language involves recognizing how multiple event mentions structurally and temporally interact with each in this one can induce event complexes that organize events with temporal order and membership relations interweaving among due to the lack of jointly labeled data for these relational phenomena and the restriction on the structures they we propose a joint constrained learning framework for modeling the framework enforces logical constraints within and across multiple temporal and subevent relations events by converting these constraints into differentiable learning we show that our joint constrained learning approach effectively compensates for the lack of jointly labeled and outperforms sota methods on benchmarks for both temporal relation extraction and event hierarchy replacing a commonly used but more expensive global inference we also present a promising case study showing the effectiveness of our approach in inducing event complexes on an external code is publicly available at this contradict the statement above regarding the lack of joint do we need to address it we need the next you show that you do not need but it reads like you just do not use if you really want to keep maybe better to say replacing a commonly more global inference even without global inference that is widely used in previous events described in natural language text requires a reader to identify how they structurally and to form an event most of the work in nlp has focused on predicate mentions and not on the event complex they form in this paper we study the induction of larger event units from text identifying a set of predicate mentions that together via and subevent form event the scarcity of jointly labeled data for these relational phenomena presents a significant technical these phenomena interact with each thus restricting the structures they to make this we propose a joint learning framework that enforces logical constraints among the relations to be by converting these into differentiable learning we show that not only does our joint training approach address the lack of jointly labeled but it also outperforms sota results on both the temporal benchmark data set and the event hierarchy benchmark data also present a promising case study on a dataset with fully annotated we study temporal and hierarchical relations of events using a joint constrained learning first obtain the event representation via an and then jointly train a perceptron to predict confidence scores for temporal and hierarchical relations before we make structured prediction via integer linear programming the framework first incorporates a contextualized encoder to characterize the events in the and then predicts the confidence scores for temporal and hierarchical relations among in the training our framework learns to enforce logic consistency among various types of event relations in both by converting declarative rules into differentiable learning objective the consistency of final prediction is enforced by global inference inference phase performs structured prediction based on integer linear programming to respect the corresponding logic constraints of utilize the benchmark dataset for the extraction task of each category of relations for training and experimental we prove the feasibility of joint constrained learning of different tasks using datasets that have partial annotations for each the labor for creating another dataset that has full the experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms the method on the benchmark of event temporal relation extraction task by and it improves over the model of training jointly without constraints by on hieve a benchmark for event hierarchy the joint constrained learning effectively bridges the tasks with limited annotated learning and promisingly leverages domain rules to support the precise learning and inference of various event

writing sentence representation learning has been widely explored in recent years and it has been shown that it improves the generalization of different downstream tasks across many even though utilizing probing methods in several studies suggests that these learned contextual representations implicitly encode some amount of explicit syntactic information further improves the performance of deep neural models in the domain of authorship these observations have motivated us to investigate the explicit representation learning of syntactic structure of in this we propose a framework for learning structural representations of the network contains two a lexical and a syntactic which take the sequence of words and their corresponding structural labels as the due to the mapping of words to their structural each word will be embedded into a vector representation which mainly carries structural we evaluate the learned structural representations of sentences using different probing and subsequently utilize them in the authorship attribution our experimental results indicate that the structural embeddings significantly improve the classification tasks when concatenated with the

attention layer neural network architectures improve,neural abstractive summarization models are flexible and can produce coherent but they are sometimes unfaithful and can be difficult to while previous studies attempt to provide different types of guidance to control the output and increase it is not clear how these strategies compare and contrast to each in this we propose a general and extensible guided summarization framework that can effectively take different kinds of external guidance as and we perform experiments across several different experiments demonstrate that this model is achieving performance according to rouge on popular summarization datasets when using highlighted sentences as in we show that our guided model can generate more faithful summaries and demonstrate how different types of guidance generate qualitatively different lending a degree of controllability to the learned is available at generating more novel and generating more faithful summaries on popular summarization datasets using xxx as in we demonstrate how different types of guidance generate qualitatively different lending a degree of controllability to the learned

baseline percentage questions assessed,this work presents our ongoing research of unsupervised pretraining in neural machine translation in our we initialize the weights of the encoder and decoder with two language models that are trained with monolingual data and then the model on parallel data using elastic weight consolidation to avoid forgetting of the original language modeling we compare the regularization by ewc with the previous work that focuses on regularization by language modeling compare the ewc regularization with the previous work that uses language modeling objectives from the original task for model the positive result is that using ewc with the decoder achieves bleu scores similar to the previous the model converges times faster and does not require the original unlabeled training data during the in the regularization using ewc is less effective if the original and new tasks are not closely we show that initializing the bidirectional nmt encoder with a language model and forcing the model to remember the original language modeling task limits the learning capacity of the encoder for the whole bidirectional poznamky analyza fisher information projekce are more important than the feedforward layers output and value projections are more important at the higher layers key and query projections are more important at lower layers previous work requires unlabeled data for mt training ewc can estimate empirical fisher on small heldout data is effective even when the and new tasks differ and then using this pretrained encoder in mt ewc is bad at this our work has nice mathematical definition faster convergence in time works only with decoder little worse than lm method works when task are similar in nature how deep should the should why only previous work shows that with the drop in performance is not that big it is much easier to implement future work investigate complementarity of ewc and lm investigate the learning rate schemes investigate the method in the scenario investigate the method

generation models conditioned by structured data is inherently due to the quality of reference texts and the training these reference texts often diverge from the information contained in the associated source data in language generation models conditioned by structured the classical training via maximum likelihood almost always leads models to pick up on dataset divergence and to incorporate them erroneously in their own generations at this we propose a reinforcement learning framework in order to reduce hallucinations and to do we rely on the recently introduced parent metric assessing the adequacy of a candidate generation with both the human reference and the source in this we build ontop of previous reinforcement learning based approaches and show that a framework relying on the recently introduced parent metric is efficient at reducing both hallucinations and evaluations on the widely used wikibio and webnlg benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of this

that jointly describe multiple due to the fact that some relations usually keep high in the same previous relation classifiers struggle to distinguish them with few annotated to alleviate the above relation confusion we propose a model equipped with two mechanisms to learn to decouple these on the one an attention which leverages the syntactic relations and relative positions between each word and the specified entity is introduced to guide the attention to filter out information causing on the other a training method is proposed to explicitly learn to distinguish relations by playing a game between classifying a sentence into a true relation and its confusing extensive experiments are conducted on the fewrel and the results show that our proposed model achieves comparable and even much better results to strong baselines in terms of the ablation test and case study verify the effectiveness of our proposed ega and especially in addressing the relation confusion

datasets show effectiveness proposed establishing new results,sentiment analysis seeks to predict the sentiment polarity of a sentence toward a specific it has been shown that dependency trees can be integrated into deep learning models to produce the performance for these models tend to compute the vectors without considering the aspect terms and fail to benefit from the overall contextual importance scores of the words that can be obtained from the dependency tree for in this we propose a novel deep learning model to overcome these two issues of the prior work on in our gate vectors are generated from the representation vectors of the aspect terms to customize the hidden vectors of the models toward the aspect in we propose a mechanism to obtain the importance scores for each word in the sentences based on the dependency trees that are then injected into the model to improve the representation vectors for the proposed model achieves the performance on three benchmark models employ graph based neural nets to incorporate syntactical structure into the they ignore the aspect term information to control the interaction between words in the syntax tree which is modeled by graph neural they neglect the consistency between the syntactic and semantic importance of the words toward the given the relative importance of the words to the given aspect term based on their syntactical role is neglected in the final representation produced by the existing to address these two in this we introduce a new model which incorporates gating mechanism to control information flow in the graph based model using the given aspect it also ensures the words that are syntactically important to the aspect term are more pronounced in the final representation of the our extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets empirically prove the effectiveness of the proposed model leading to new results on all three benchmark

adversarial as attack shown straightforward enact implementation requires minimal knowledge believe attacks expose crucial blind spot machine translation needs addressed,machine translation always suffers catastrophic forgetting during the continual learning process which means the model tends to forget all its previously learned knowledge when further trained with new data with different like from different domains or it is not clear what happens during this process and what causes this more it is not clear whether this is due to the overall change of the model or the impact of certain in this we focus on the domain adaptation task of nmt under the continual learning we put forward two ways for evaluating the importance of the parameters and show that the translation quality mainly dependents on the most important parameters of the then we analyze the behavior of the parameters according to their importance for the model during the continual learning process and it shows that the important parameters for the translation still play major roles for the translation after the continual learning what is the catastrophic forgetting shown as the substantial decline of translation quality with the rise of translation is mainly due to the change of these important we propose some practical methods to overcome the catastrophic forgetting by controlling the updates of parameters differently based on their neural machine translation models usually suffer from catastrophic forgetting during continual training where the models tend to gradually forget previously learned knowledge and swing to fit the newly added data which may have a different a different although many methods have been proposed to solve this we cannot get to know what causes this phenomenon under the background of domain we investigate the cause of catastrophic forgetting from the perspectives of modules and parameters the investigation on the modules of the nmt model shows that some modules have tight relation with the knowledge while some other modules are more essential in the domain and the investigation on the parameters shows that some parameters are important for both the and translation and the great change of them during continual training brings about the performance decline in we conduct experiments across different language pairs and domains to ensure the validity and reliability of our tracing parameter variation in this progress and depict the influence of different model depict the relationship between them so that we can work out solutions to the catastrophic forgetting problem based on these the background of domain adaptation for machine we found that some parameters play an essential role in both general domain and translation and the change of them brings about the performance decline in based on these we propose a solution to detect these important parameters and accordingly suppress their fluctuation during domain experimental results prove our method can greatly improve the translation quality in and meanwhile minimize the negative influences on

find evidence that recent neural ranking models have fundamentally different characteristics from prior ranking for these models can be highly influenced by altered document word sentence order and inflectional they can also exhibit unexpected behaviors when additional content is added to or when documents are expressed with different levels of fluency or we find that these differences can depend on the architecture and not just the underlying language

regularization for learning and demonstrate we also demonstrate the robustness of the learned representations by using noisy and show that the learned representations are more transferable to related we also demonstrate that the new objective leads to models that are more robust to different levels of noise in the training and can generalize better to related tasks with limited labeled task

use special math in paper title or online hate speech on social media has become a problem in recent nefarious groups have developed large content delivery networks across several mainstream and fringe outlets to deliver cascades of hate messages directed both at individuals and thus addressing these issues has become a top priority for social media three key challenges in automated detection and classification of hateful content are the lack of clearly labeled evolving vocabulary and lexicon etc and the lack of baseline models for fringe outlets such as in this we propose a novel framework with three major we engineer an ensemble of deep learning models that combines the strengths of we incorporate a tuning factor into this framework that leverages transfer learning to conduct

hallucination problems conditional sequence,representation learning of textual networks poses a significant challenge as it involves capturing amalgamated information from two underlying network and node textual for most existing approaches learn embeddings of text and network structure by enforcing embeddings of connected nodes to be then for achieving a modality fusion they use the similarities between text embedding of a node with the structure embedding of its connected node and vice for achieving modality fusion they model similarities involving networks structure and textual attributes of nodes in an this implies that these approaches require edge information for learning embeddings and they cannot learn embeddings of unseen in this paper we propose an approach that achieves both modality fusion and the capability to learn embeddings of unseen the main feature of our model is that it uses an adversarial mechanism between text embedding based and structure embedding based generator to learn efficient then for learning embeddings of unseen we use the supervision provided by the text embedding based in addition we propose a novel architecture for learning text embedding that can combine both mutual attention and topological attention which give more flexible text through extensive experiments on we demonstrate that our model makes substantial gains over several in comparison with previous it gives up to improvement in performance in predicting links among nodes seen in the training and up to improvement in performance in predicting links involving nodes not

social media for deriving mental health status of users focus on the depression detection for case management and referral to healthcare workers require practical and scalable depressive disorder screening and triage for prevention or treatment of severe this study aims to design and evaluate a decision support system to reliably determine the depressive triage level by capturing depressive symptoms expressed in user tweets through the emulation of patient health that is routinely used in clinical the limit on tweets incentivizes the usage of creative artifacts in the language forms a general fabric of communication as it permits users to express themselves more this complicates the reliable detection of depressive the reliable detection of depressive symptoms from tweets is challenging because the limit on tweets incentivizes the use of creative artifacts in the utterances and figurative usage contributes to effective we propose a novel bert based robust learning framework to accurately identify the depressive symptoms using the auxiliary task of figurative usage our proposed novel task sharing aware enables automatic selection of optimal information across the bert layers and tasks by of our results show that modeling figurative usage can demonstrably improve the model robustness and reliability for distinguishing the depression our approach achieves statistically significant improvements over the sota social media platforms have evolved as a vital source of information for where the users exchange their emotional states and majority of the

meaningful embedding obtained nmt module seen figure based may good idea learn good representation signs replace word embeddings achieve advancements nslt nmt this representation learning open our research mainly focused before introducing discuss existing three tokenization approaches following tokenization the first approach using glosses glosses intermediate representations signs words directly applicable nmt framework without certain shortcomings glosses rarely exist real gloss annotation requires laborious process special glosses unique sl requires special effort obtain glosses

property,availability of large code repositories and discussion has enabled code search as a common activity among they tend to express their intent as a query in natural language to find examples of related however performance of such systems are restricted due to limited shared vocabulary across code and user query and lack of semantic understanding of the user in this we evaluate siamese network for the task of code building on two sub our siamese model can jointly learn between code and its description and represent them based on their semantic we evaluate the performance of applying siamese networks as a model directly feeding code and its description as a model stacked on existing state of the art we experiment on datasets and baseline and conclude that applying siamese networking on top of base models yield better embedding and improves the performance of the code sesearch taks with the increase in the number of open repositories and discussion the use of natural language for semantic code search has become increasingly the accuracy of the results returned by such can be low due to limited shared vocabulary between code and user query and inadequate semantic understanding of user query and its relation to code siamese networks are well suited to learning such joint relations between but have not been explored in the context of code in this we evaluate siamese networks for this task by exploring multiple extraction network these networks independently process code and text descriptions before passing them to a siamese network to learn embeddings in a common we experiment on two different datasets and discover that siamese networks can act as strong regularizers on networks that extract rich information from code and which in turn helps achieve impressive performance on code search beating previous baselines on programming we also analyze the embedding space of these networks and provide directions to fully leverage the power of siamese networks for semantic code

unlabeled we are motivated by the nlp problem of word sense for any we have a set of candidate labels from a knowledge but the label set is not necessarily representative of what occurs in the there may exist labels in the knowledge base that very rarely occur in the corpus because the sense is rare in modern and conversely there may exist true labels that do not exist in our knowledge our aim is to obtain a classifier that performs as well as possible on examples of each      mmon class  that occurs with frequency above a given threshold in the unlabeled set while annotating as few examples as possible from classes  whose labels occur with less than this the challenge is that we are not informed which labels are common and which are and the true label distribution may exhibit extreme we describe an active learning approach that explicitly searches for rare classes by leveraging the contextual embedding spaces provided by modern language and incorporates a stopping rule that ignores classes once we prove that they occur below our target threshold with high we prove that our algorithm only costs logarithmically more than a hypothetical approach that knows all true label frequencies and show experimentally that incorporating automated search can significantly reduce the number of samples needed to reach target accuracy

based on its cover would be utterly beneficial to many modern retrieval considering that the complete digitization of books is an extremely expensive at the same it is also an extremely challenging task due to the following there exists a wide variety of book many of which are not concretely book as graphic vary in many different ways such as textual even for books of the same book cover designs may vary due to many external factors such as target reader with the growing competitiveness in the book the book cover designers and typographers push the cover designs to its limit in the hope of attracting the book classification systems become a particularly exciting research topic in recent in this we propose a deep learning framework to solve this the contribution of this paper is our method adds an extra modality by extracting texts automatically from the book and models are evaluated thoroughly for the task of book cover we develop an efficient and salable framework based on the images and texts shown on the covers a thorough analysis of the experimental results is given and future works to improve the performance is the results show that the framework significantly

gain insight into document to perform topic existing neural models use document representation as input followed by variational inference and learn distribution through reconstructing such methods have mainly focused on analysing the effect of enforcing suitable priors on document little importance has been given to encoding improved document features for capturing document semantics in this we propose a novel which models document as a sequence of tokens instead of bow at the input layer and processes it through an lstm whose output is used to perform variational inference followed by bow we apply attention on lstm outputs to empower the model to attend on relevant words which convey topic related we hypothesise that attention can be performed effectively if done in a topic guided manner and establish this empirically through we factor in distribution to perform topic aware attention achieving results with percentage improvement over score of existing sota topic models in npmi coherence metric on four benchmark datasets also obtains better document classification accuracy owing to learning improved we qualitatively discuss that attention mechanism enables unsupervised

colon long dash,the attention mechanism is a key component of the neural revolution in natural language processing as the size of models has been scaling with the available computational a number of pruning techniques have been developed to detect and to exploit sparseness in such models in order to make them more the majority of such efforts have focused on looking for attention patterns and then them to achieve or pruning the weights of the attention mechanisms based on statistical information from the training in this we marry these two lines of research by proposing attention pruning a novel pruning framework that collects observations about the attention patterns in a fixed dataset and then induces a global sparseness mask for the through attention we find that about of the attention computation can be reduced for language modelling and about for machine translation and language inference with bert on glue while maintaining the quality of the using our we discovered important distinctions between and which could guide future nlp research in our approach could help develop better models for existing or for new nlp and generally for any model that relies on

features reward enable augmentation diverse types text the code made available upon,neural machine has achieved great success with the help of large amount of parallel different model architectures have different advantages and translation but it is hard to integrate them all together to one the ensemble method is too for monolingual data are also not fully some works such as and unsupervised machine translation have tried to utilize monolingual data of target whereas the utilization of source side monolingual data still need be further in this we propose a framework with diverse teachers to make one model be able to learn advantages and diversities from other and monolingual data of source side language can also be utilized to further improve the translation this method is very simple but much empirical results show that our method can obtain further improvements on the standard and translation despite the recent success on image has only achieved limited gains on structured prediction tasks such as neural machine translation this is mainly due to the compositionality of the target where the prediction hypotheses lead to the notorious reinforced mistake in this we revisit the utilization of multiple diverse models and present a simple yet effective approach named learning first exploits individual models to generate pseudo parallel and then cooperatively trains each model on the combined synthetic leverages the fact that different parameterized models have different inductive and better predictions can be made by jointly exploiting the agreement among each unlike the previous knowledge distillation methods built upon a much stronger is capable of boosting the accuracy of one model by introducing other comparable or even weaker can also be viewed as a more efficient alternative to extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of on several benchmarks with significant is available at takes advantage of different parameterized networks to generate diverse proper pseudo parallel and then dramatically reduce the bias through strategic combination of the pseudo we first train several nmt teachers with heterogeneous then use the heterogeneous teacher models to label unlabeled data respectively and finally use the labeled data and unlabeled data to jointly train a student nmt is very simple but much empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of on several where we even outperforms a strong ensemble which strategically aggregates multiple models for has been shown effective to improve the accuracy of neural machine translation in practice it cannot be widely adopted due to the high computation and memory cost for involving all individual transductive method has been proposed to overcome this suffers the premise that the test data has to be available in in this we present a simple yet effective approach named cooperative training nmt where we firstly use individual models to translate the source corpus into pseudo parallel and then cooperatively train all models on the translated synthetic leverages the fact that different parameterized models have different inductive and better predictions

previous coping with ambiguous questions has been a perennial problem in dialogue although clarification by asking questions is a common form of human it is hard to define appropriate questions to elicit more specific intents from a in this we propose a reinforcement model to clarify ambiguous questions by suggesting refinements of the original we first formulate a collection partitioning problem to select a set of labels enabling us to distinguish potential unambiguous we list the chosen labels as intent phrases to the user for further the selected label along with the original user query then serves as a refined for which a suitable response can more easily be the model is trained using reinforcement learning with a deep policy we evaluate our model based on user clicks and demonstrate significant improvements across several different the ability to ask clarification questions to solve ambiguity and missing information phenomena is essential for question answering the current research mainly uses questions generation or questions ranking to ask a clarification which lead to low success rate and redundant insufficient use of the graphic user interface results in more interactions with there is usually no guarantee for replying the user after the to solve these we propose a question clarification method based on intents intents are extracted from the historical frequently asked questions of our the recommended intents can provide more concise candidates for user to once an intent is the system guaranteed to provide a clear question list relative to the real we use the reinforcement learning method to recommend and the most challenging problem is cold the reward is designed to recommend the most relevant clear question list and maximize the information gain after clicking one intent for better question the method we proposed for question clarification can solve both ambiguity and missing information experiments on interactions with more than million online users shows the effectiveness of this

discourse such as rst and has been shown to improve an increasing number of downstream nlp showing positive effects and synergies of discourse with important while methods for incorporating discourse become more and more the growing need for robust and general discourse structures has not been sufficiently met by current discourse usually trained on small scale datasets in a strictly limited number of this makes the prediction for arbitrary tasks noisy and the overall resulting lack of discourse trees poses a severe limitation to further in order the alleviate this we propose a new strategy to generate tree structures in a unsupervised fashion by extending a latent tree induction framework with an the proposed approach can be applied to any such as syntactic discourse parsing and due to the especially difficult annotation process to generate discourse we initially develop a method to generate larger and more diverse discourse in this paper we are inferring general tree

acquisition methods typically require laborious and expensive human as a their scale is often as no context is provided during the the resulting causality knowledge records typically do not take the context into to explore a more scalable way of acquiring causality in this we jump out of the textual domain and investigate the possibility of learning contextual causality from the visual compared with pure learning causality from the visual signal has the following causality knowledge belongs to the commonsense which is rarely expressed in the text but rich in most events in the video are naturally which provides a rich resource for us to mine causality knowledge all the objects in the video can be used as context to study the contextual property of causal in we first propose a dataset and then conduct experiments to demonstrate that with good language and visual representation models as well as enough training it is possible to automatically discover meaningful causal knowledge from the further analysis also shows that the contextual property of causal relations indeed taking which into consideration might be crucial if we want to use the causality knowledge in real and the visual signal could serve as a good resource for learning such contextual and all used codes are available in we first identify events from the which are represented with natural and then leverage the visual signal to predict the contextual causal relations among these in this we mimic how human beings learn causality and explore the possibility of acquiring causality knowledge with visual to do we first define the task of mining contextual causality knowledge from visual which aims at evaluating abilities to identify causal relation given certain visual and then employ the to annotate a dataset on top of we propose a causal model that can utilize the images as context to better acquire causality different from existing knowledge acquisition the best of our proposed solution the first one

chemical reactions labeled commercially available reaction classification with bert match classification accuracy,recent success in speech representation learning enables a new way to leverage unlabeled data to train speech recognition in speech representation a large amount of unlabeled data is used in a manner to learn a feature then a smaller amount of labeled data is used to train a downstream asr system using the new feature based on our previous work decoar and inspirations from other speech representation we propose decoar a deep contextualized acoustic representation with vector we introduce several modifications over the we use transformers in encoding module instead of we introduce a vector quantization layer between encoder and reconstruction we propose an objective that combines the reconstructive loss with vector quantization diversity loss to train speech our experiments show consistent improvements over other speech representations in different without a asr model trained on hours of librispeech labeled data with decoar features outperforms the model trained on the full dataset with filterbank we propose a novel approach for vector quantized deep contextualized acoustic following the same schema in we first exploit a large amount of unlabeled audio data via representation where we reconstruct a temporal slice of filterbank features from context the new resulting deep contextualized acoustic vector quantized representations are then used to train a small asr system using a small amount of labeled audio in our we show that systems trained on decoar consistently outperform ones trained on other acoustic giving the and comparable results with on experiments on our approach can drastically reduce the amount of labeled data unsupervised training on librispeech then supervision with hours of labeled data achieves performance on par with training on all hours
