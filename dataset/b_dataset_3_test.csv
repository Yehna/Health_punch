research alfred sloan foundation research anthology anthology,the major challenges of the are closely related to the general vqa and qa in the medical domain and we see a lot of interesting solutions evolving over we present the survey with respect to the related datasets and methods in the following a number of research projects have been initiated for the development of benchmark datasets to promote the works in the medical the genomic corpus released as part of the task is one of the benchmark datasets for the medical qa it focuses exclusively on scientific a small number of questions in the dataset are not sufficient to evaluate the efficiency of the qa this constraint led to the release of several other such as question answering for machine reading evaluation and biomedical semantic indexing and question answering the consists of the biomedical text on alzheimer while bioasq gathers information from various heterogeneous sources to address questions from the biomedical a number of such as and a few more focused on different medical are also the images in the dataset have different modalities and contain radiological markings such as short it may also contain a stack of that is not the case with the existing medical in general vqa are unlike where a question can be asked about any disease from any part of the is the most popular dataset that contains real world images along with their corresponding most of the vqa were created using the image captions from visual question answering is one of it is the most significant and commonly used dataset for the vqa task which was published as a part of the vqa the vqa dataset primary issue was its inherent bias and language priors too had a major impact on the responses to the questions that inspired the design of the second version of this vqa is a larger and more balanced in this we use the rad and medical vqa which are different from the existing vqa the obvious reason is their focus on the medical which offers distinguishing the and answers must be clinically relevant in order to be a part of this dataset which is not a constraint in the vqa the building of phrases for sentences is another most of the sentences are complex with a lot of medical terms while being simple and straightforward in the stated another difference is the incomparable size of the medical domain data resources are limited compared to the general domain data resources which are usually huge the number of reference which is just is another drawback of this vqa tasks are primarily based on three key generating representations of images and passing these inputs through a neural network to produce a and then generating the correct fig illustrates this framework where the key components can take a wide variety of vqa systems differ from each other in the way they fuse although most vqa algorithms used the classification this strategy can only produce answers seen during the response is generated one word at a time using the response is still restricted to words seen in the course of for question most methods for vqa uses a variant of recurrent neural network rnns are capable of handling sequence but when rnn processes lengthy context data is easily lstm proposal mitigated the dependency in the researchers also discovered that the respective route from the decoder to the encoder will be reduced if the input sequence is contributing to network the model combines the above two points and improves the the gated recurrent unit is also and widely simplification of the as for the image feature convolutional neural network are used where and deep residual networks are the most popular the application of attention on the image can help to improve the performance of the model by discarding the irrelevant parts of the attention are usually incorporated in the models so that they may learn to attend to the important regions of the input attending image is not enough but question attention is important too as most of the words in the question may be irrelevant so simultaneous integration of both question and image attention is the fundamental concept behind all these attentive models is that for answering a specific certain visual areas in an image and certain words in a question provides more information than the stacked attention network and the dynamic memory network used image features from a cnn feature map spatial an attention layer is specified by a single layer of weights using the question and image feature defined to calculate attention distribution across image using a weighted this allocation is then applied to the cnn feature map to pool across spatial feature it creates a global representation of the image that highlights certain spatial vqa depends on the image and question being processed this was achieved earlier by using simplified methods such as concatenation or but these methods fail to capture the complex interactions between these two pooling was proposed where the idea was to approximate the outer product between the two enabling a much deeper interaction between similar concepts have been shown to work well to improve the image multimodal compact bilinear is the most significant vqa technique used in bilinear it calculates the outer product in a reduced dimensional space instead of explicit calculation to minimize the number of parameters to be then this is used to predict the relevant spatial features according to the the major change was the use of mcb for feature fusion instead of methods for must be different from general vqa as the size of the datasets is the other challenge with is to balance the number of image features with the number of clinical features in the deep learning network to avoid drowning out of the clinical on bounding box too cannot be applied directly as medical images lack the bounding box for medical there are many diagnostic most of deal with single disease problems and focused primarily on easily identifiable areas such as the lungs and in contrast to these deals with multiple diseases at the same time apart from handling multiple body parts which are difficult for machines to the imageclef introduced the challenge of medical domain visual question the system submitted by achieved the best performance in for medical visual question they built their best performing systems using for image feature extraction and multimodal factorized for utilized the and for image and question they used the mechanism to fuse the language and vision their best performing system stood second among all the submitted systems in the the third best system submitted by uses the model for image feature extraction and lstm for question they utilized the stack attention network to fuse the question and image in the second of submitted the best system for medical visual question the proposed approach utilized the bert for question representation and model for image they fused the question and image features using mfb here were only limited datasets were released as part of the and challenge received a total of runs from participating in the second edition of the questions follow a temporal sequence and naturally cluster into different this information is very important to predict the response regardless of the authors use a similar approach where they first identify the and use this information for answer our isolates the learning path based on rather than using this knowledge as a this type of information can also affect model performance as some of the vqa models perform better than others for certain types of these models can be intelligently combined to leverage their varied we propose a simple model with a question segregation module which segregates the learning path based on the question types to reap the benefits of dedicated we use to encode image feature and for question feature

comprehensive interaction also consider applying approach categories study domain adaptation problem across different,in this we present the existing work on incorporating terminological and ne information into nmt several approaches have been proposed to incorporate linguistic knowledge into mt models in order to improve translation one of the approaches is to include the knowledge as features or extra tokens for the for morphological part of speech tags and syntactic dependency labels were proven to improve translation quality when translating between english and german and english to a different approach used interleaved ccg supertags within the target word sequence comparing favourably to learning when translating from german and romanian to information can also be added to the target side by replacing it with a linearised and lexicalised constituency tree which shows improved word reordering when translating from czech and russian to english both in automatic and human a second approach is to modify the architecture of the recurrent neural network to capture linguistic the encoder of the nmt ensemble was replaced with a graph convolutional that places no rigid constraints on the structure of the sentence which showed improvements when using syntactic dependency trees for the source language translating from english to german and an alternative approach modified the encoder to process syntactic representations of the source and the attention to be able to address both sentences and phrases which improved results for english to japanese a different approach is to use learning to improve translation quality by adding information from similar such as pos for two decoders were used to predict lemmas and factors independently when translating from english to which led to increased vocabulary another approach generated both the translation of the tagged the pos of the source and recognised nes in the source language different architectures that shared attention mechanisms and even decoders were showing improvements of all individual tasks when translating from german to english different subword unit strategies have been generating compositional representations of the input words by using an auxiliary recurrent neural network showed improved results compared to systems using encoding when translating from morphologically rich languages to another alternative used segmentation which compared favourably to encoding when translating english to english to bengali and bengali to what is a combination of both strategies showed even better other such as linguistically motivated or word segmentation methods were also explored when using rbmt and it has also been investigated whether the encoder of nmt models learns syntactic information from the source sentence when performing three different translating from english to french and english to generating a linearised constitutional tree from and from english to permutated the authors found that different types of syntactic information are captured in different several strategies have been tested for dealing with ne for identifying nes before translating and replacing the tokens with special tags or translating the ne using an external translation model this model showed performance improvements over the baseline model when translating sentences with person names from simplified chinese to a different approach used alignment information to align source and target language nes before translating as using information from both sides can help improving ne the model showed improvements over the baseline when translating from simplified chinese to addressing nes by using additional features to indicate where each ne starts and ends was also investigated which showed improvements when translating from english to romanian and terminology translation has been approached in different there are works focused on terminology translation in the use of a model within pbsmt capable of combining both an static phrase table and language model with extensions compared favourably both to the baseline model and an markup mode that enables enforcing the translation of some tokens in the sentence when translating between english and italian and english and a mechanism named guided nmt decoding similar in concept to the markup for was also comparing favourably to baseline both in english to german translation and automatic that translating from english that is likely to have low usually mt to more adequate this model was only able to guide the but not to enforce the a approach using acceptor to enforce the constraints was proposed showing improved results when translating from english to german and simplified chinese in scenarios using gold tokens and phrases present in the reference but not produced by the baseline or this information would be present in translation memories and glossaries provided by a possible an approach that encodes the information encoded in knowledge terminological expressions and as embeddings that are then concatenated to the word embeddings was tested showing improved results for english to german the performance of smt and nmt have been explored when translating terminology without both using baseline and domain adapted models showing that nmt models benefit the most from domain if requested by reviewers adds a feature and terms next to the terms in the source sentence to promote copy outperforms baseline for english to german with small computing cost create corpora using both supervised and unsupervised lexicon showing improvements on all domains both with bidirectional lstm and transformer models when translating english to german data selection has been used to improve the performance of the trained reduce the computational cost of or both to the best of our applying data selection to the selection of targeted tests sets that frequently exhibit

appropriate which is extremely inflexible and if intent categories some such as naive bayes adaboost support vector machine and logistic regression have also been explored to improve the performance of intent but these approaches still have difficulty in understanding the deep semantics of user utterances due to the ambiguity and irregularity of user with the rise of deep learning many neural

filling is often regarded as a sequence labelling compared with intent slot filling heavily relies on semantic traditional approaches directly extract semantic concepts from the user utterance based

cnn and joint pointer and attention are some typical works of this research intents and slots represent the semantics of user actions from different granularity there have been some works attempting to jointly model intent detection and slot how to better model the interactions between slots and intents is the crux of the proposed using an neural network to jointly model the two without directly exchanging information between intents and it simply relied on a joint loss function to consider both introduced a mechanism to improve slot filling by conditioning on the learned intent proposed using embedding as a special gate function to guide the process of slot proposed a framework to explicitly incorporate intent information to slot which can further reduce the error these unidirectional interaction approaches ignored the fact that slot filling results are also instructive to the intent detection thus it is necessary to consider the interactions between intents and slots for these two for proposed a interrelated model to achieve the effects of mutual adopted a hierarchical capsule network to leverage the hierarchical relationships among and intents in an in contrast to these lines of we propose to explicitly model the mutual support in a parallel which is more straightforward and does better in capturing the complicated interdependence among slots and empirical results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our which can further improve the performance of slu

et,there is a very broad line of work on online learning with convex one of the earliest online learning methods is the perceptron other more sophisticated methods are kernel second order perceptron and online gradient the online gradient descent algorithm can readily be applied to deep neural networks to learn from a streaming multiple iterative passes over each data point is normally required due to the optimization landscape and the training of deep neural networks with the online gradient updates is usually recurrent neural networks with an external memory system exhibit a sequential adaptation capability when the data stream is provided in a custom the present work is along the similar line with an advantage that our approach is generic and can be applied to an arbitrary neural network more explored a similar setup as ours with a focus on online reinforcement learning in changing their approach involves maintaining a mixture of neural network models over the entire data stream and this can be quite expensive to scale to large neural a more complex online scenario was also introduced based on the maml algorithm where the is continually trained while we in this work focus on a learned online learning algorithm that can generalize on unseen test data more our approach falls into the category of has been extensively studied in learning setup where a algorithm assumes an access to a distribution of tasks with a few labelled examples unlike online task identities are known and the examples are not strictly provided in an sequential order in the online learning setup does not restrict the number of examples to be only a a learned online learning algorithm should be capable of a fast adaptation when there is only a few examples available from a new but also scalable to a larger data regime to be able to continually improve its underlying the later can be challenging for learned learning algorithms due to short horizon biases introduced during the learned learning an important for training does not generalize across different data continual learning investigates the catastrophic interference in neural networks in a similar setup as online the prior continual learning algorithms have mainly been focused on a small handful set of the online cifar benchmark introduced in this work offers an interesting testbed to evaluate continual

performance on the pubmed but it cannot encode long this model has been improved by deploying a attention the model is also enhanced by incorporating prior knowledge from a knowledge the data used in these approaches are automatically labeled via distant as discussed in previous distant supervision always introduces noisy incorrectly labeled in the binary relation extraction this problem is addressed by using a weaker distant supervision this assumption takes all labeled sentences with the same entity pairs into a bag and assumes that only one sentence in this bag is correctly some work also trained an extra selector which selected the correctly labeled sentences as the training data of the relation extraction most selectors are reinforcement learning these reinforcement selectors cannot be applied to relation extraction which is more challenging than the binary relation to the best of our our proposed work is the first to apply reinforcement learning on the relation extraction we propose an agent selector to select the correctly labeled sentence we also propose a weaker distant supervision assumption to label both consecutive and to encode them a novel universal relation

   introduce the background of this including the comparison between singing voice synthesis and text to speech the challenges of high fidelity singing voice text to speech aims to synthesize speech voice from a given which has evolved quickly from early concatenative synthesis statistical parametric to neural network based parametric and to currently neural the models directly map input text or phonetic characters to output which greatly simplifies the training pipeline and reduces the requirements for linguistic and acoustic popular tts systems include tacotron with the rapid tts has been applied to various scenarios and has been the basic technology in singing voice synthesis svs has distinct features compared with since svs needs more information in addition to the given lyric to synthesize singing voices with wide range of long vowel singing voices focus more on expression and emotion rather than content as in speaking which requires higher sampling rate than speaking voices to ensure voices and thus throws great challenges for singing singing voices usually leverage high sampling rate to convey for popular music websites such as apple qq music and netease music all use high sampling rate high sampling rate increases the difficulty of singing high sampling rate causes wider spectrum band in frequency where different frequency bands with distinctive characteristics make it hard for acoustic high sampling rate causes longer waveform in a fixed period of where more sampling points and fluctuations make it difficult for most previous works on svs usually adopt or sampling rate as used in there indeed exist some works using or sampling they either leverage as acoustic features in slow autoregressive neural or use vocoder such as and to generate which cannot fully exploit the potential of high sampling rate and thus cannot yield good voice popular pipeline for singing voice synthesis usually contains an acoustic model that maps lyrics and music score input to acoustic features such as and a vocoder that generates singing waveform given generated acoustic singing voice not only requires acoustic features generated by the acoustic but also largely depends on the quality of previous svs systems mostly utilize and as although these vocoders are their synthesis quality is usually some svs systems leverage neural but most of are based on autoregressive generation which suffer from slow inference speed especially for audio with high sampling in this we adopt a vocoder called parallel for the fast with specific designs to ensure the voice quality while handle the high sampling rate

modified version of namely the proposed models in utilized attention models to focus on differences between two sets of features extracted from the enrollment utterance and the questioned utterance using in the common approach taken in these the attention models were added to the end of deep learning the addition of attention models in this way has shown to improve the accuracy of baseline models against datasets in each of these a different approach was taken in and the attention models used in these studies replaced the statistical pooling layer of an the proposed models utilized tdnn to extract features from attention models were then used to aggregate the features into an the model proposed in was evaluated against the evaluation set and the proposed model in was evaluated against the voxceleb test set both models showed substantial improvements compared to their baseline the majority of the aforementioned studies have used the features obtained from dnns as the memory component of the attention the queries of the attention models were also originated from the last hidden layer of the model from which the embeddings are dnns learn to extract a latent representation from the input data without necessarily preserving localization with respect to the input information while the use of the last hidden layer of a dnn for extracting the query of an attention mechanism can be advantageous due to its reduced number of high levels of granularity and a localized relationship with respect to the input may not be compared to the methods proposed in previous the attention model proposed in this paper does not require embeddings obtained from dnn and can operate on spectrograms extracted from raw audio the granularity of the attention model can be improved to attend to while different attention mechanisms depend on the specific architectures and our proposed frequency attention mechanism can be used along with various models and as proven in the experiment by adding the frequency attention to multiple a substantial improvement is achieved on both tasks of ser and

among,this section provides background information on the methodologies used for natural language processing includes the current commonly used embedding and language for word different organizations and institutions continuously seek to find the best methods for word representations we describe the most commonly used word embedding model according to recent language models have recently received massive attention in the nlp they can be defined as a black box that understands natural language and can be applied and to solve nlp the process uses inexpensive unlabeled data to learn the initial parameters of a neural network bidirectional encoder representations from transformers is one of these language models and is state of the art for many nlp word word embedding is one of the most popular recent natural language processing it refers to any technique aiming to map words to a dense vector representation that captures words semantic meanings that can be used to estimate similarities between words for the primary purpose of this mapping is to represent linguistic terms in dense vectors to be utilized by machine learning a word is mapped to an vector appropriate for representing the meaning of a specific different neural network models have been used to construct word as word vectors provide meaningful numerical descriptions of words based on their word embedding has proven to be a powerful technique for extracting the most meaningful representations of the evolution of word embedding has resulted in tremendous success in various nlp tasks like text document part of speech named entity sentiment and so many researchers have built models to reach the best meaningful word vector representations by using word and the most common models are google and stanford developed by google research team to overcome traditional word representation techniques by representing words in a more dense and meaningful representation given a corpus the word vector representation is computed from a large corpus fed into the model to produce vectors representing word the meaning of words is obtained from surrounding words within a specified window representation can be obtained from different model continuous and continuous google released a model representing word meanings that have been successfully utilized in many nlp tasks in recent the model is trained on a vast corpus of billion words and is publicly a word vector is more meaningful if the model is trained on a progressively larger corpus glove is another word embedding model developed it is an unsupervised learning algorithm that obtains a vector representing a word     semantic meaning by using distributional the algorithm performs several operations on a constructed this is a costly process for a huge even though it only requires a single pass through the this matrix is used to construct word vectors instead of using a approach like in google the main difference between google     and glove is that is a model in which a loss function is used to evaluate the prediction while glove is a glove has been trained on many platforms such as web crawl and and provides a model for each one with different bidirectional encoder representations from transformers is the latest revolution in nlp language model bert is a deeply bidirectional language model trained on very large datasets based on contextual other previous language models are which means they consider context only from or whereas bert adds a neural network dense layer for classification to construct a fully language model ready for the advantage incorporates the contextual or the meaning with the generic meaning and trains it for a specific classification bert provides high performance for nlp tasks and improves on the results from traditional nlp tasks seek to find the best contextual word and glove generate an embedding representation for each regardless of its contextual and a word meaning is changed according to its associated if the word has different meanings based on glove and represent the word as a single such as the word in the phrases bank deposit and river the word bank would have a single representation in the whole which ignores other meanings of the and glove are described as contextual representation has two in which the representation is learned in one from left to or in which the representation of the word in learned from both left to right and right to bert is deeply bidirectional by jointly conditioning both left and right contexts in all bert models have different releases that differ according to model cased or uncased and the number of and they are all available deep learning is a subfield of machine learning which uses successive layers for accurate representations of the learning process is performed by exposing training data to the model to give if the learning model consists of only one or two then it is called shallow deep learning usually uses a neural network in order to learn these and the neural networks are structured in the learning process aims to find the values of the neural network that map an input example to its correct and a loss function is which measures the distance between the predicted and actual different constructions of layers give different deep learning neural networks form the basis for deep and one of the most common neural network architectures used for deep learning construction is memory lstm is a recurrent neural network developed as a solution for solving the problem of vanishing gradient in an rnn is a specific type of neural network which considers the history or context in the computation of the rnn includes a memory to preserve the previous computational result and feeds back the previous set of hidden unit activation to the network with the current this particular architecture is beneficial for problems that require the history to be involved in the such as speech recognition and stock rnns suffer from the vanishing gradient in which the weights are lost in a deeper layer of the thereby failing to capture very long to avoid this lstm replaces each node by a memory which consists of an input forget output and a node connected back to the memory cell in a specific layer uses the hidden state in the previous layer during the current time and the hidden state of the current layer from the previous the forget gate decides which information should be ignored in the cell and the input gate and tanh layer decide which information is stored in the cell then using the sigmoid function to decide the final

resources available research,several recent papers have focused on developing interpretability techniques for the closest to ours is wherein a soft erasure function for edges is learned individually for each unlike our method gnnexplainer cannot as such guarantee that gated edges do not affect as we show in our experiments separate optimization for each example results in overfitting through hindsight bias which compromises explore including gradient and excitation apply layerwise relevance to the gnn these methods represent an alternative to but as we have noted their faithfulness is and the lack of implementation is problematic significant engineering is still required to develop these techniques for certain networks with attention as the aggregation another popular approach is to treat attention or gate scores as a measure of even leaving questionable many gnns use neither gates nor for those that the gates as we demonstrate in section are not necessarily outside of one line of research involves decomposing the output into a part attributed to a specific subset of features and a part attributed to the remaining for the computational cost for realistic use cases is like us

experiment pretraining techniques specific transformer results french benefit transfer,sentiment analysis aims to predict the sentiments of a sentence toward the given aspect we summarize previous approaches for this task into two based models and given a sentence and an aspect category mentioned in the based models directly generate the aspect sentence then predict the sentiment of the aspect category based on the although some based models achieve they do not provide reasons why they make a they lack compared with based attention based models are more they first find aspect sentiment then generate aspect representations based on the sentiment attention mechanism was first used by wang et to find aspect sentiment jiang et proposed new capsule networks to model the complicated relationship between aspect categories and where the normalization weights and routing weights can be viewed as attention can and perform the acd task and the acsa task jointly and achieves these attention based models directly use the given aspect category to find the aspect sentiment which may cause the mismatch problem mentioned since scan to the best of our the first model for we review some methods for the sentiment analysis atsa predicts the sentiments of the given aspect terms that occur in a early methods for atsc try to incorporate syntax knowledge using recursive neural dong et first converted the dependency tree of a sentence to a binary they proposed an adaptive recursive neural network that is applied on the binary tree to propagate the sentiments of words to the target the representation of the target node is used to predict the sentiment label of the similar to aspect the target is a sequence of words that occur in the phrase recursive neural network makes the representation of the aspect term richer by using syntactic information from both the dependency and constituent trees of these methods that have to convert the original dependency tree into a binary tree may move modifying sentiment words farther away from the aspect a few researches use graph neural network to incorporate syntax knowledge and achieve the huang et applied graph attention network over the dependency tree of a sentence and the representations of the nodes corresponding to aspect terms is used to predict the sentiment of the aspect zhang et applied graph convolutional network over the dependency tree of a then the representation of the node corresponding to the given aspect term is used to retrive sentiment words that are used to predict the sentiment of the aspect since aspect categories may not occur in these methods cannot be used for the acsa task

by complex machine learning systems has been of increasing these explanations can be divided into two feature importance explanations and natural language the methods that provide feature importance explanations aim to provide the user with the subset of input tokens that contributed the most to the prediction of the as pointed out by these explanations are not as one would need to infer the missing links between the words in order to form a complete for in the natural language inference if the explanation is formed by the words and one would not know if the model learned that dog is an

alternative to other forms of such as generating explanations is a challenging task models that generate natural language works on verifying models that generate natural language explanations are very identify the risk of generating natural language explanations that mention attributes from a strong class prior without any evidence being present in the in this i bring awareness to another which is of generating inconsistent identify the risk of mentioning attributes from a strong class prior without any evidence being present in the in the problem of explaining the behaviour of a model is either via or via modifications of the model methods generate explanations by analysing the model behaviour in different regions of the input or via token sensitivity analysis methods augment models to generate explanations jointly with the magnitude of inner and attention at the time of this no method in the literature focuses on the problem of assessing the quality of produced and on identifying inputs yielding to inconsistent natural language adversarial generating adversarial examples is an active research area in natural language for analyse the robustness of extractive question answering models on examples obtained by adding adversarially generated distracting other works analyse sensitivity to small random character and simple transformations requiring lexical and world most works build on the requirement that the adversarial input should be a small perturbation of an original or should be preserving the semantics of the original but leading to a different while this is necessary for testing the robustness of a our setup does not have this and any pair of inputs that causes the model to produce inconsistent explanations existing adversarial models do not always require the adversarial input to be grammatically and often they can change words or characters to completely random this is acceptable for certain such as summarisation of long pieces of where changing a few words would likely not change the main flow of the in cases like where the inputs are short and the model is tested for it is desirable that the adversarial examples are gra mmatically most to my no previous adversarial attack for models generates exact target given a find an input that causes the model to generate the exact given closest to this propose an adversarial framework for removing or adding tokens in the target sequence for the task of machine require the presence of tokens anywhere in the target they only test with up to three required and their success rate dramatically drops from for one token to for three tokens for the task of automatic their method would likely not generalise to exact target attempted to find inputs where a model trained on snli violates a set of logical this scenario in lead to finding inputs that cause the generation of inconsistent their method needs to enumerate and evaluate a potentially very large set of perturbations of the removing or replacing tokens with their thus being computational besides the computational it also may easily generate ungrammatical their scenario does not address the question of

concerning what the correct answers or just learn how to provide an answer to a recent advancements of methodologies have shed new light on generative for the attention mechanism is used to determine what content in a sentence should be and the and the long memory mechanisms are used to generate each word in a question these only deal with question generations without generating correct to a

the expsense of having substantially more their experiments show that the meteor and scores on the questions generated which are to points higher than the earlier results on the same dataset of such low accuracies are still a long way to go to meet the requirement for our and on top of low it is also unknown whether the questions generated are grammatically correct because these measures do not

features using a neural network these metrics have a common drawback that the evaluation is based on costly to assess the quality of a generated text we need to obtain a corresponding some work discussed how to evaluate the quality of generated text in the and leveraged regression models to fit human ruse use sentence embeddings generated by three different models and aggregate them using a mlp proposed a method that also uses a regression model to predict the while the predictions are based on hidden representations generated using bert as the these methods require ratings assigned by human annotators as training data which are also costly to in our method is unsupervised and requires no human ratings for discussed both and settings for summarization their method basically converts both the generated text and the text for comparison into hidden representations using encoders like elmo and calculates the cosine similarity between t in the setting and the setting stands for the reference text and the source document the experiment results show that their method correlation with human ratings is lower than especially in the designed a based method to compare the content difference of two although this method provides a novel perspective and the evaluation basis is easy to the results show that it has not achieved better performance than rouge considering the lower correlation with human supert generates pseudo references and evaluates the quality of the test summaries by calculating word mover distance between the pseudo reference summaries and the test it is similar to moverscore which uses the references instead of pseudo supert mainly focuses on summarization and its performance is inevitably worse than the work closest to our model is an evaluation

considering the structures of rule texts propose explicit memory tracker which firstly addresses at each dialog emt recurrently tracks whether conditions listed in the rule text have already been satisfied to make a in this we also explicitly model entailment reasoning for decision but there are three key differences between our and we apply discourse segmentation to parse the rule which is extremely helpful because there are many conditions in our stacked transformer layers extract better features for entailment which could be seen as a generalization of their recurrent explicit memory different from their utilization of entailment prediction which is treated as learning for decision we directly build the dependency between entailment prediction states and the predicted discourse analysis uncovers linguistic structures which can be useful for many downstream such as coherent text generation and text summarization discourse information has also been introduced in neural reading design a semantic mechanism to supervise different heads of the transformer by discourse relations and coreferring different from their use of discourse we use it as a parser to segment conditions for entailment

question generation improve question generation since par previous best model,citare correlating neural and symbolic representations of language in the last few several methods have been devised to obtain meaningful explanations regarding the linguistic information encoded in nlms they range from techniques to examine the activations of individual neurons to more domain specific such as interpreting attention mechanisms studying correlations between representations or designing specific probing tasks that a model can solve only if it captures a precise linguistic phenomenon using the contextual embeddings of a model as training features these latter studies demonstrated that nlms are able to encode a variety of language properties in a hierarchical manner and even to support the extraction of dependency parse trees investigated the representations learned at different layers of showing that lower layer representations are usually better for capturing surface while embeddings from higher layers are better for syntactic and semantic using a suite of probing found that the linguistic knowledge encoded by bert through its layers follows the traditional nlp pos semantic roles and then quantified differences in the transferability of individual layers between different showing that higher layers of rnns are more while transformer layers do not exhibit this increase in alternative approaches have been proposed to study the linguistic information stored in nlms and how this information evolve under different learning objectives or during a proposed a method based on canonical correlation analysis and mutual information to analyze how several learning such as machine standard language modelling and masked language modeling determine the evolution of the individual representations between layers in the transformer using the same training model architecture and parameter initialization they found that the evolution of a token representation across layers changes according to the three different learning used svcca to investigate how representations of linguistic structure are learned over time in a discovering that different aspects of linguistic structure are learned at different rates within a single recurrent acquiring pos tags early but continuing to learn topic information later in compared with the aforementioned our work provides a more in depth analysis of the linguistic knowledge encoded by bert before and after a process through a wide range of probing each of which corresponds to a specific and how this knowledge affects the ability of the model to solve a specific downstream to our this work is the first despite previous work have shown that nlms implicitly encode specific linguistic there has been few studies that have attempted

learned with a topic model in a procedure they term but do not follow the method from that we employ pretrained models like bert have offered an attractive choice of teacher used successfully for a variety of tasks such as sentiment classification and paraphrasing work in distillation often cites a reduction in computational cost as a goal although we are aware of at least one effort that is focused specifically on interpretability commonly quantified automatically using is the current standard for evaluating topic model recently several authors have proposed additional metrics focused on the diversity or uniqueness of topics no one metric has yet achieved acceptance or consensus in the such measures fail to distinguish between the case where two topics share the same set of top

to scale the memory usage of modules tinybert uses a distillation framework to learn from a bert distilbert uses knowledge distillation during and retains a large fraction of bert recent papers have analyzed the attention patterns in trained some studies hypothesize that multiple attention heads capture linguistic phenomena like links and dependency other studies show that pruning those heads leads to minimal performance degradation on downstream others note that there are recurring patterns in attention distributions corresponding to different attention heads which are not language or while our study also questions the role of heads for language modeling and downstream we focus on making modifications to the lm and not on analyzing published this points to things there is a lot of redundancy in the attention patterns in and the linguistic capabilities of heads is not a given even if the lm achieves very good perplexity a transformer and note that there are recurring patterns in attention distributions corresponding to different attention heads which are not language or task while and hypothesize and show that there are multiple attention heads which could be performing linguistically motivated tasks like resolution and subsets of dependency note that pruning those heads leads to no performance degradation on downstream use greedy algorithms to prune a large number of heads while suffering very little this redundancy in attention is exploited in blockbert and longformer where attention is paid mainly to a local context these implementations need significant changes to the enforce local constraints on the attention patterns to reduce computation and build deeper models with longer the studies that are perhaps most similar to ours explore fixed attention patterns for machine replace all attention heads in the encoder with gaussian distributions centered around the position of each token while observing a minimal reduction in bleu substitute all but one head with fixed attention patterns in each encoder layer and note little performance both these studies enforce hard constraints on the and try to match baselines in terms of speed and our

network as an alternative to the instead of computing dynamic attention weights over all previous aan places equal attention on all previously decoded words via averaged places equal attention on all previous decoded words treats each previous hidden state structure is introduced in original an average attention and a gating proposed a lightweight recurrent simple recurrent unit to speed up the proposed simpler simple recurrent unit a simpler version of which consists of only two matrix because of the autoregressive property of the decoder in a standard transformer model during the reducing computation cost in the decoder is much more important than in the recent publications have suggested the structure of deep shallow decoder can speed up inference while maintaining a similar bleu proposed a lightweight which has about less than half parameters and operations but still achieves similar translation quality as previous works also claimed that quantization of the model can provide computational speed improvement at inference time model pruning techniques have been proposed to compress the model and reduce the computation there are structured pruning and unstructured pruning structured pruning methods prune the filters or even on the other unstructured pruning methods prune the redundant which result in sparse in this we explore only structured pruning in the transformer attention is not all the heads are proposed the idea of pruning head through head importance integrates the regularization technique to prune the attention note both of these two methods require a trained there is only one which consists of one ssru and one attention in at we prune of attention heads of a simplified while the others pruned attention heads on the original the model has been machine translation stacking attention and network is the key structure of the in order to achieve a higher translation it grows deep and the computation requirement also exponentially it puts significant pressure on the efficiency of the efficiency is even more important during the

apply unstructured pruning techniques remove weights whole,learning refers to problems where classifiers are required to generalize to unseen classes with only a few training examples per class to overcome challenges of potential most fsl methods adopt approach where knowledge is extracted and transferred across multiple there are two major approaches towards approach whose goal is to learn feature extractor that extract and generalize to emerging classes and approach that aims to optimize model parameters from few samples in this we focus mostly on learning we extend prototypical network in which prototypes are not only represented by support samples but also matching information between support and query fsl methods are evaluated in episodic procedure due to the major principle that test and train conditions must match each episode represents a task in which the models explicitly to learn minimize the loss on an query set given the labeled we claim that this evaluation is lack of practicality for two main evaluation on random samples could not help us understand the strengths or weaknesses of the for if the trained model overfits a subset of novel it is impossible to pinpoint the overfitting classes with episodic in realistic there is a need to categorize unlabeled samples into one of the rather than a set of sampled episodic testing does not provide an systematic in our we propose a more challenging but realistic evaluation setting where unlabeled samples are only inferred once with a probablility distribution over a fixed set of classes in novel or joint label recent fsl works adopt matching and aggregation methods to improve fsl performance instead of constructing prototypes purely from support recent works integrate matching information between support and query samples on multiple introduces and introduces additional attention and proposes more advanced attention on on the other adopts soft matching between support and query samples to build local context representation for both support and query these methods have been proven effective in relation classification they rely on overly level matching which potentially causes overfitting problems towards either seen or unseen set of our work mainly differs in two comprehensive matching for information matching and matching on levels that are extracted dynamically for effective knowledge especially in gfsl

compared strong further research may concerned learning new,we denote the input space by for an input we denote the structured output space by the entire space of structured outputs is denoted we define an energy parameterized by that computes a scalar energy for an at test for a given input prediction is done by choosing the output with lowest solving requires combinatorial algorithms because is a discrete this becomes intractable when does not decompose into a sum over small of relax this problem by allowing the discrete vector to be let denote the relaxed output they solve the relaxed problem by using gradient descent to iteratively minimize the energy with respect to propose an alternative that replaces gradient descent with a neural network trained to do to mimic the function performed in this is parameterized by and trained with the goal that show that inference networks achieve a better error than gradient descent given pretrained energy training of energy functions and inference proposed a structured hinge loss for learning the energy function parameters using gradient descent for the inference step required during replaced the inference step in the structured hinge loss with training of a inference trained with the following where is a structured cost function that computes the distance between its two the new optimization objective where is the set of training pairs and alternatively optimized and which is similar to training in generative adversarial one challenge with the optimization problem above is that it still requires training an inference network for proposed a objective that avoids this by training two inference networks jointly for inference and for as this loss can be viewed as the sum of the and perceptron and are alternatively the objective for the energy function parameters the objective for the other parameters where is a supervised loss which is added to aid in training inference in this we use the standard cross entropy summed over all like we drop the zero truncation when updating the inference network parameters to improve stability during which also lets us remove the terms that do not have inference we use two independent networks but with the same architecture for the two inference

bert is only used as one part of which results in a sequence along with other sophisticated modeling our approach can better this allows us to better model interactions between arguments and added a

expression they note that whenever it is not possible to figure out the meaning of a given expression from its immediate local it is common to consult dictionaries for definitions or search documents or the web to find other global context to help in in light of they introduce the task of describing a given phrase in natural based on its local and global to tackle this the authors introduce a model which consists of two context encoders as well as a description our proposed uses a more practical variational allowing us to take advantage of explicitly modeling the while also leveraging deep contextualized word representations for more informative context ishiwatari when reading a it is common to become stuck on unfamiliar words and such as polysemous words with novel rarely used internet or emerging if we humans cannot figure out the meaning of those expressions from the immediate local we consult dictionaries for definitions or search documents or the web to find other global context to help in can machines help us do this which type of context is more important for machines to solve the to answer these we undertake a task of describing a given phrase in natural language based on its local and global to solve this we propose a neural description model that consists of two context encoders and a description in contrast to the existing methods for english explanation and definition generation our model appropriately takes important clues from both local and global experimental results on three existing datasets and a dataset newly created from wikipedia demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over previous our model is also related to in which conditional variational autoencoders extension of the original variational autoencoder were proposed for generating diverse structured mainly in the context of image and visual object segmentation and our work is also related to cvae models that have been developed for the domain of natural language specifically

contextual definition modeler achieves performance terms automatic human evaluation demonstrating effectiveness conclude something,in the early unsupervised models exploit the lexical overlaps of sentences to measure the lexical cohesion between sentences or paragraphs by moving two sliding windows over the the cohesion between successive text units could be measured and a cohesion drop would signal a segment even if these models do not require any training they only show limited performance in practice and are not general enough to handle the temporal change of the languages more supervised methods have been devised for topic segmentation because of their more accurate predictions and greater one line of research frames topic segmentation as a sequence labeling problem and builds neural models to predict segment boundaries proposed a simple bilstm model to label if a sentence is a segment boundary or they demonstrated that along with engineered features based on cue phrases their model can achieve marginally better performance than early unsupervised proposed a hierarchical neural sequence labeling model for topic segmentation and showed its superiority compared with their selected supervised and unsupervised around the same proposed an bilstm model to classify whether a sentence was a segment boundary or by considering the context around the work we present in this paper can be seen as pushing this line of research even further by encouraging the model to more explicitly consider contextual relation by optimizing a as well as to prefer more information from the neighbor context through restricted with a certain window another rather different line of works first trains neural models for other and then uses these outputs to predict trained a convolutional neural network network to predict the coherence scores for text sentences in a pair with large cohesion are supposed to belong to the same their to rank framework asks for the number of which limits their model applicability in on our selected framework overcomes this constraint by tuning a confidence threshold during over model the training a sentence with the output probability above this threshold will be predicted as the end of a following a very different introduced a topic embedding layer into a bilstm after training their model to predict the sentence the learned topic embeddings can be utilized for topic one critical flaw of their method is that it requires a complicated which includes topic extraction and synset whose errors can propagate to the main topic segmentation in our proposal only requires the plain content of the training data without any complex but no other additional which also ensures its applicability to more early works on coherence modeling merely predict the coherence score for documents by tracking the patterns of grammatical role transition more researchers started modeling the coherence for sentence pairs by their semantic similarities and used them for higher level coherence prediction or even other including topic proposed a neural coherence model which first identified the salient semantics from adjacent sentence pairs to represent sentence the document coherence score is then predicted based on the consecutive sentence relation found that a document coherence was highly correlated with the summation of the coherence scores of all consecutive sentence pairs in this they devised a discriminative coherence model only for sentence they applied this model to all the sentence pairs in a document and added them together to represent the overall coherence of this demonstrated the strong relation between coherence modeling and topic they assumed that a pair of texts from the same document should be ranked more coherent than a pair of texts from different a pair of texts from the same segment should be ranked more coherent than a pair of texts from different segments of a with these they created a training corpus for coherence prediction by assigning different coherence scores to the texts from the same different segments but the same and different then they proposed the corresponding and further use this model to directly conduct topic following their second we propose a neural solution in which by injecting a auxiliary topic segmentation and sentence level coherence modeling can mutually benefit each we agree with their hypothesis and believe that with a proper way of topic segmentation and sentence level coherence modeling can mutually benefit each

added to improve the alignment of long sentences vaswani et have proposed to replace the rnns with networks which has improved the training speed and the accuracy of nmt many nmt models have proposed taking the context into account by concatenating surrounding sentences or extra features to the current input with otherwise no modifications to the for rios et have trained an nmt model that learns to disambiguate words given the context semantic landscape by simply extracting lexical chains from the source and using them as additional other researchers have proposed concatenating previous

most methods roughly leverage all context sentences in a fixed size that is tuned on development sets or full context in the entire document they ignore the individualized needs for context when translating different source some works have noticed that not all context is useful explore the context selection in the framework and select context sentences that yield highest forced the method cannot optimize docnmt model at training and requires model at inference sharpen the attention weights between the source and context sentences through the sparsemax and implicitly select context with high attention the method lacks direct supervision over context and it cannot cover the situation where context is not inspired by the summarization our approach is different from above docnmt our approach can explicitly select dynamic size of context sentences for the translation of different source

compression reconstruction seen we propose dynamic selection method choose variable sizes context sentences the candidate context sentences scored selected two proposed we train whole model via reinforcement design novel reward encourage selection useful context when applied existing docnmt approach improve translation quality in select context sentences larger candidate explore effective ways extend approach select context,our proposed which we call consists of two essential the editorial agent and the the agent sends action signals to the which then deterministically transforms the input sentence according to the we train the agent to find action signals so that the sentences demanded by the in the following we first share the background of and then present how to put the task and our approach on the framework we next explain the core algorithmic details and finish with explanations about training and inference is a popular approach in rl as represented by deep leverages an function to estimate the value of a pair of state and action with respect to a policy the function is represented as the expected reward for the r where is a is an is a reward function for the and is the discount to solve a text summarization task via we first need to appropriately define the and reward to solve a text summarization task via we first need to define the state action and reward we formally represent our approach as the task in the next in our given an input sentence we define a state in regard to each word an action for the state is chosen from among the three where is defined as the agent then reiterates the predictions until it finishes determining an action on all by defining the state in regard to a single word instead of a whole sentence and asking the agent to determine the prediction we can handle variable sentence lengths in natural note that this is not a the agent conducts the prediction in the order of let us describe how we create the state in terms of creating the state we dynamically obtain it by encoding that we call local encoding and global encoding we represent a state via the concatenation of two types of word embeddings that we call local encoding and global encoding in terms of creating the state we dynamically obtain it by the concatenation of two type encodings that we call local encoding and global encoding next we explain how to encode to send the agent contextual such as the previous the prediction and the whole we dynamically create a state with a concatenation of two local encoding and global encoding to create the two we map to a vector with an arbitrary encoder and is repeatedly used throughout the process regardless of the we define the local encoding as where and are learnable bias vectors for the action and prediction status of the the all elements in the bias vector have a same trainable value corresponded to the action or the status of prediction all elements of the bias vector are filled with same value corresponded to the superscription has same size with and the all elements have same value corresponding to has a predicted action if is already we create the global encoding in a fashion as where is computed with used instead of the conventional because caused the exploding gradient in our thanks to the bias terms in and the in is aware of the previous decisions for each word and the interactions between those in bert encoding enables us to take a whole sentence into decoding by language model with action in this we explain how to compress and reconstruct sentences in a deterministic manner with the this transformations occur after the agent finishes the action prediction on all words in the given for the we use bert which is a masked language model trained to predict portions in a mlm can estimate the probability distribution of word in a sentence as mlm can estimate the probability distribution of word in a sentence as borrow the notations of the input sentence x where is the same as except that it has a mask at the position denotes a function to return a word with the highest probability for the if there are multiple we apply the prediction in an autoregressive fashion the procedure to obtain and by using and mlm is shown in figure we convert to a skeleton sequence consisting of tokens where is if is otherwise a null token we convert each word in with a rule that returns if is otherwise a null token is epsilon is defined in two meanings where is each token in obtained after the we then define our compression and reconstruction functions and as a word is predicted only for given by in but it does so for all in we set the original sentence as a prefixed which comes from in compression and in to make mlm aware of a former an example is shown in figure where mlm receives learning is not perfect as the compression input and predicts words for the if there are multiple we conduct the prediction in an autoregressive fashion note that while any language model can be used for the mlm is advantageous because it utilizes before and after and there is no restriction on looking ahead at upcoming reward in this we explain the reward computation of the chosen action by referring to and as stated in we have an action sequence for every step each element of has the predicted action if already when we apply and to all the we can obtain a list of tuples a tuple let us experience enables us to evaluate a pair with respect to a single in this we propose three techniques step violation and summary to evaluate the agent behavior with the stepwise refer to table to see how these work in reward computation with an actual before moving on to the let us define two important notions throughout this compression rate and reconstruction rate the cr learning assumes that the higher values of and are we use these for calculating rewards and pruning the task of the agent is to produce an action sequence with which the an appropriately compressed sentence while keeping the reconstruction as we define the reward function as where is the step reward that are designed to encourage the agent to improve the compression and reconstruction where the scores of and are designed to encourage the agent to improve the compression and reconstruction we call their multiplication a step is an additional score from the qualitative assessment of which we explain returning to the step reward it is a multiplication of and defined as where is a minimum requirement for the reconstruction rate at the step and is defined as with the hyperparameter intuition for about if we set that requests perfect then regardless of we need to forgive reconstruction failure to some extent because of the information loss in and adjusts the allowed number of for requests the model to recover at least half of the original sentence determines to what extent the agent is forgiven to fail the which is necessary because the reconstruction failure is inevitable due to the information loss by this constraint is stricter in earlier steps than later because reconstruction becomes harder as compression let us describe the behavior of the step reward the reward is when the agent chooses or because due to there being no change in the length of the reward gets a positive value when the agent chooses and satisfies the requirement for the reconstruction rate is larger when more words are already removed because becomes difficult in such the reward gets a negative value when the agent chooses but the reconstruction rate is less than the in the step reward recommends as long as the agent can recover the original and or is for evaluating and and are evaluated through bonus reward explained it allows reconstruction failure lower than the threshold because information loss by compression is sequential including that performed by our essentially suffers from error propagation caused by incorrect predictions at an earlier the violation penalty mitigates this issue by giving a negative reward to the latest problematic action and excluding experiences after the in addition to we introduce the hyperparameter which represents a minimum requirement for the compression denotes its threshold at the defined as and the agent must satisfy the condition as the we forcibly assign reward for the pair at the step when the agent breaks either constraint of or in we ignore experiences from step and if the agent keeps predicting until the we define figure shows how these constraints work for the experience although the step reward considers the compression and reconstruction it ignores the critical aspects of the generated summary such as replacement with a shorter synonym and fluency as a we explain the mentioned in the previous paragraph and describe how to reflect such qualitative assessments to the reward given to the as the essential properties for we take three perspectives into and the informativeness refers to how much retains the original meaning of and the shortness and fluency are to reflect these perspectives onto the agent we define as where computes a similarity score of and and computes a of and are hyperparameters to adjust the importance of and in addition to we give to the experiences from the beginning to steps as defined in the step reward let us explain the terms inside the square brackets the first which is the multiplication of and aims for shortness and it gets a higher value when the agent achieves the right balance of compression and the second term aims to evaluate informativeness brought about by returns a semantic similarity score in the range of through the sentence vectors of and rather than just checking exact matches of the last term represents fluency via the of given by a language model we use bert for the computation of and is the ratio of the number of operated it becomes closer to when the agent is reaching a finishing the prediction on all words by avoiding the violation which makes in the agent who fails at an earlier stage gets a small value of leveraging the experiences in the replay buffer the agent learns the policy for summarizing a sentence within the we utilize dqn to learn the corresponding to the optimal policy by minimizing the where and is a target whose parameters are periodically updated in accordance with the latest network during the collection of rl requires the agent to explore an action on a given state for finding a better as a unique point in this the agent must explore not only the action but also the order to for both we use the algorithm that stochastically forces the agent to ignore and to behave randomly our modeling that provides and for each step has another advantage in terms of the for the final we use at the step that achieves the best balance of the compression and reconstruction where this is based on the relationship of compression and reconstruction as seen in the

deep heterogeneous neural interaction networks learn various feature representations comment interactions sessions experimental results exhibit promising performance evidential explanation we also find learning interactions contributes such results encourage future studies develop advanced graph neural networks better representing interactions heterogeneous in worthwhile model information propagation temporal correlation comments,work in the that may not be a good we review existing relevant work in three learning from noisy learning from multiple and learning from noisy our work is closely related to existing work on learning from noisy to deal with label several studies adopt a data cleaning approach that detects and removes mislabeled this is achieved by outlier detection heuristics or reinforcement learning one drawback of this data cleaning approach is that it can discard many samples and incur information different from data some works adopt a data correction the most prominent idea in this line is to estimate the noise transition matrix among labels and then use the transition matrices to the instances or adapt the loss and generate label noise by flipping clean labels based on such noise transition they are thus not applicable to our weak supervision setting where no clean labels are strategies have been explored to adjust the input training these techniques weigh training samples according to the predictions confidence noise assumption a clean set or the similarity of their descent directions a few studies have also explored designing denoising modules for neural our method differs from them in our method learns conditional reliability scores for multiple and these methods still require clean data for while ours does learning from supervision the crowdsourcing area also faces the problem of learning from multiple sources different strategies have been proposed to integrate the annotations for the same such as estimating the confidence intervals for workers or leveraging approval voting compared with our problem is different in that the multiple sources provide only noisy supervision instead of more related to our work are data programming methods that learn from multiple weak supervision one seminal work in this line is snorkel which treats true labels as latent variables in a generative model and weak labels as noisy the generative model is learned to estimate the latent and the denoised training data are used to learn our approach differs from data programming methods where we use a soft attention mechanism to estimate source which is integrated into neural text classifiers to improve the performance on unmatched in two instead of using generative models to estimate the latent clean we use a soft attention mechanism to estimate source which can be integrated into neural text classifiers and trained data programming methods suffer from limited performance on unmatched while our approach addresses this issue by jointly training a label denoiser and neural is a classic technique for learning from limited supervision the key idea is to use a model confident predictions to update the model itself one major drawback of is that it is sensitive to the model can be by its own wrong predictions and suffer from error propagation although is a common technique in only a few works like westclass have applied it to our differs from westclass in two it performs weighted aggregation of the predictions from multiple which generates pseudo labels and makes the model less sensitive to the error in one single it uses temporal which aggregates historical pseudo labels and alleviates noise extends by allowing two classifiers to exchange their expertise until they reach a this is typically be achieved by letting the two classifiers annotate unlabeled samples with their confident predictions and update each the idea has been extended to deep neural qiao used to train two networks that have consistent predictions over all the and meanwhile make each network resistant to the adversarial examples from its peer network to prevent them from collapsing into each used different regularizations and input augmentation conditions to improve deep proposed the which uses output smearing to initialize modules and then on labeled data to augment model compared with these and our method alleviates the error propagation issue by estimating conditional source reliability and performing weighted majority these methods are designed for settings with clean whereas our method learns from noisy

cryptography used since antiquity encode important there many unsolved ciphers historical residing national private recent corpora collection projects solving classical ciphers automatic methods needed step analyzing in concerned automatic algorithms solving type book word tokens systematically replaced numerical encoding decoding done reference dictionary possessed sender while type code automatic decipherment algorithms yet the contributions work figure gives simplified typology typology geared toward explaining contribution context related for fuller picture classical reader directly for discuss systems substitution key evolves encoding cipher german enigma involve the substitution may take form simple caesar substitution the caesar cipher easily solved since offsets the algorithm need able recognize candidate plaintexts form good since candidates even simplest language model a simple substitution cipher uses substitution table built randomly permuting since possible algorithmic decipherment many successful many systems search substitution tables result candidate plaintexts score well according character language model use search techniques like beam exact the main practical challenge decipher short in long easy always followed cipher immediately guess stands plaintext more sophisticated ciphers use homophonic plaintext characters replaced by applying high nondeterminism frequent cryptographer flatten ciphertext character homophonic ciphers occur frequently historical the copiale cipher example german secret society these ciphers also attacked successfully for homophonic zodiac cipher solved em restarts bayesian sampling beam search employ powerful neural language model break short ciphers in present use neural language increase also avoid physical substitution tables stolen prove in sender recipient verbally agree front shared document specific edition novel moby when enciphering plaintext letter token like sender selects random letter f shared character plaintext f might enciphered the next plaintext f might enciphered solve one book part two beale cipher treat cipher regular homophonic using algorithm zodiac together character language one might imagine exploiting fact book written ciphertext unit known ciphertext unit probably fh unlikely appear effective algorithm ignores other methods proposed attacking book crib dragging contrast make substitutions single historical system mix letter substitutions word such system called a large proportion encrypted material consists a famous example antoine rossignol grand used reign the sender receiver copies huge tables map words onto numbers if enciphering tables kept type code hard one might guess frequent cipher token stands word quickly becomes challenging decide number means practice means even take task automatically deciphering newswire encrypted arbitrary substitution employing bayesian given huge ciphertext decipher tokens from one billion ciphertext recover word method clearly inapplicable world in present consider instead using sender receiver verbally agree use book because may difficult find word like paragon novel like moby sender receiver often agree shared pocket nearly if paragon word sender might encode such codes popular throughout employed example george scovell napoleonic wars john jay war they used late world german diplomats employed langenscheidt pocket dictionary key communicate cities mexico germany in guard intercepted messages able make bit headway deciphering real breakthrough came obtained applicable dictionary appear automatic algorithms solving codes without suggests national security services long ago digitized published books applied find book renders given code natural according in develop algorithm automatically attacking apply corpus codes late we implement evaluate techniques pronounce chinese text without use pronunciation dictionary parallel the em method achieves accuracy method achieves by combining two obtain significantly exceeds prior we also demonstrate current methods unsupervised matching vector spaces sensitive structure in presence mappings pinyin mapping accuracy severely leaving open opportunity design robust unsupervised vector mapping,figure gives a simplified typology of typology is geared toward explaining our contribution in the context of related for a fuller picture of classical the reader is directly to and for we do not discuss here systems in which a substitution key evolves during the encoding such as the cipher or the german enigma involve the substitution may take the form of a simple as in the caesar substitution the caesar cipher can be easily solved by since there are only offsets to the algorithm need only be able to recognize which of the candidate plaintexts form good since of the candidates will be even the simplest language model will a simple substitution cipher uses a substitution table built by randomly permuting the since there are possible algorithmic decipherment is more there are many successful many of these systems search for substitution tables that result in candidate plaintexts that score well according to a character language model and they use search techniques like beam and exact the main practical challenge is to decipher short in a very long it is easy to the because it is always followed by the same cipher which we can immediately guess stands for plaintext and so more sophisticated ciphers use homophonic in which plaintext characters are replaced by applying high nondeterminism to frequent the cryptographer can flatten out ciphertext character homophonic ciphers occur frequently in historical the copiale cipher is a example from a german secret society in the these ciphers can also be attacked successfully by for the homophonic zodiac cipher can be solved with em with restarts bayesian sampling or beam search employ a more powerful neural language model to break short ciphers more in the present we use a neural language increase and also avoid physical substitution tables that can be stolen or prove in a sender and recipient verbally agree up front on an shared document such as the of or a specific edition of the novel moby when enciphering a plaintext letter token like the sender selects a random letter f from the shared it is the character in the the plaintext f might be enciphered as the next plaintext f might be enciphered solve one of the most book part two of the beale cipher they treat the cipher as a regular homophonic using the same algorithm as for the zodiac together with an character language one might imagine exploiting the fact that the book is itself written in so that if ciphertext unit is known to be then ciphertext unit is probably not as fh is unlikely to appear in the effective algorithm ignores such other methods have been proposed for attacking book such as crib dragging in contrast to make substitutions at the a single historical system will mix letter substitutions and word such a system is called a a large proportion of the encrypted material in consists of a famous example is antoine rossignol grand used during the reign of the sender and receiver each own copies of huge tables that map words onto numbers if the enciphering tables are kept this type of code is very hard to one might guess that the most frequent cipher token stands for the word but it quickly becomes challenging to decide which number means practice and which means even take on the task of automatically deciphering newswire encrypted with an arbitrary substitution employing a bayesian given a huge ciphertext of they can decipher of those tokens from one billion ciphertext they recover over of the word this method is clearly inapplicable in the world of in the present we consider instead of using the sender and receiver verbally agree to use an book as a because it may be difficult to find a word like paragon in a novel like moby the sender and receiver often agree on a shared pocket which has nearly all the if paragon were the word in the the sender might encode it as such codes have been popular throughout employed for example by george scovell during the napoleonic wars and by john jay during the war they were used as late as world when german diplomats employed the langenscheidt pocket dictionary as a key to communicate between the cities of mexico and germany in that the guard intercepted messages and was able to make a bit of headway in deciphering but the real breakthrough came only when they obtained the applicable dictionary there appear to be no automatic algorithms for solving codes without the suggests that national security services have long ago digitized all published books and applied to find the book that renders a given code into natural according to in this we develop an algorithm for automatically attacking and we apply it to a corpus of codes from the late

deep nlp models there has been substantial work in gaining better understanding of deep neural nlp by visualizing dense hidden found that some dimensions of the final representation learned by recurrent neural networks capture the effect of intensification and negation in the input revealed the existence of interpretable cells in a lstm model for language for they found a cell acting as a line length counter and cells checking if the current letter is inside a parenthesis or a presented interesting findings about cnns for text classification including the fact that one convolutional filter may detect more than one pattern and may also suppress negative many recent papers studied several types of knowledge in bert a deep model for language and found that syntactic information is mostly captured in the middle bert layers while the final bert layers are the most inspired by many we make the assumption that each dimension of the final representation captures patterns or qualities in the input which are useful for understanding the roles of these dimensions is a prerequisite for effective model and we exploit an explanation method to gain such an explaining predictions from text classifiers several methods have been devised to generate explanations supporting classifications in many such as natural language texts rules extracted rationales and attribution scores some explanation such as lime and shap are and do not require access to model other methods access the model architectures and parameters to generate the such as deeplift and lrp in this we use lrp to explain not the predictions but the learned features so as to expose the model behavior to humans and enable informed model debugging text classifiers using human feedback early work in this area comes from the interaction studied the types of feedback humans usually give in response to predictions and some of the feedback collected was used to improve the classifier via a user presented an explanatory debugging approach in which the system explains to users how it made each and the users then rectify the model by words from the explanation and adjusting important even without explanations an active learning framework proposed by asks humans to iteratively label some chosen features and adjusts the model parameters that correspond to the these early works target simpler machine learning classifiers and it is not clear how to apply the proposed approaches to deep text there have been new attempts to use explanations and human feedback to debug classifiers in some of them were tested on traditional text for showed a set of lime explanations for individual svm predictions to humans and asked them to remove irrelevant words from the training data in subsequent the process was run for three rounds to iteratively improve the proposed which is an explanatory interactive learning at each it selects an unlabelled example to predict and explain to users using and the users respond by removing irrelevant features from the caipi then uses this feedback to generate augmented data and retrain the while these recent works use feedback on features and individual our framework uses feedback on the learned features with respect to the big picture of the this helps us avoid local decision pitfalls which usually occur in interactive machine learning what makes our contribution different from existing work is that we collect the feedback on the not the individual and we target deep text classifiers which are more complex than the models used in previous

explicitly reasons about whether utterances contain a mechanism that is similar to our procedure for returning once these have been they are parsed into corresponding code blocks that can then be other work leverages conversations to learn new generating queries for users to respond to used this conversational structure in a robotics setting similar to but focused on learning new rather than

pretraining language modeling massive datasets revolutionized one reason method works pretraining shapes model hypothesis giving inductive biases help learn linguistic tasks numerous probing studies provided support idea showing language models learn representations encode linguistic features feature learning first step acquiring helpful inductive models must also able learn features the nlu datasets models often ambiguous contain often support multiple possible neural networks mind models shown represent linguistic features sometimes fail use nlu instead adopting shallow surface generalizations to recent work probing pretrained models advocates shifting focus study away whether represent linguistic features favor whether learn useful representations features we investigate roberta acquires inductive biases we track separately roberta representation linguistic features preferences linguistic generalizations surface generalizations change amount pretraining data we pretrain roberta scratch datasets ranging words evaluate models alongside roberta series experiments probe inductive biases pretrained model time downstream we probe models three kinds conduct control experiments models unambiguous binary classification tasks test whether learn represent simple linguistic surface conduct ambiguous experiments following poverty stimulus design illustrated figure in pretrained model ambiguous binary classification task training set consistent linguistic generalization surface we test classifier disambiguating data reveal generalization model extension preference among two conduct inoculation experiments test hard sway model surface bias adopt linguistic we introducing small amounts disambiguating data otherwise ambiguous training we automatically generate data call resulting dataset pronounced the results show roberta acquires stronger linguistic bias pretraining roberta strongest linguistic requires little inoculating data reliably make linguistic in models pretraining data generally induced adopt linguistic generalizations less inoculating we also find large gap amount pretraining data roberta needs learn linguistic features necessary generalize amount needs learns prefer features the control experiments unambiguous data reveal models little pretraining actually represent linguistic nonetheless show strong surface in main contribution pretraining linguistic bias learning devoted extracting learning features we conclude helpful inductive biases learned current models require abundant data the implications conclusion point two probably continue pretrain increasingly massive training sets improve generalization learning abilities models like since models learn useful features hope future advances could accelerate reducing amount data needed learn features to aid release msgs pretrained there increasing interest studying inductive biases neural much work grown numerous findings models often fail generalize ways task designers for demonstrate ambiguity widely used nlu datasets like squad multinli leads models like bert adopt surface despite fact represent linguistic this continues problem models like roberta show overall linguistic bias tasks like underlying linguistic feature depends combination significant syntactic semantic world it stands reason representations preferences high level features require data

peripheral we conclude emphasising work gender coreference translation requires care ensure effects interventions well testing scenarios capture full complexity work impact gender,there is increasing interest in studying the inductive biases of neural much of this work has grown out of numerous findings that these models often fail to generalize in ways that task designers for and demonstrate that ambiguity in widely used nlu datasets like squad and multinli leads models like bert to adopt some surface despite the fact that they represent linguistic this continues to be a problem for models like roberta which show an overall linguistic bias in our for tasks like the underlying linguistic feature depends on a combination of significant syntactic semantic and world it stands to reason that representations and preferences for such high level features require more data to learn than the features we other work has used the poverty of stimulus design to study inductive biases associated with particular neural architectures during syntactic train rnns on a morphological prediction task using artificial languages derived from naturally occurring english finding that rnns show a recency bias in acquiring agreement train a models on generated data ambiguous between a surface and a structural generalization to learn the inversion rule in english question they find while models show a structural sequence models do conduct related experiments on inversion and other english structural and find that bert likely acquires a structural bias from more abstract inductive biases have also been using learning in an artificial show that rnns lack a bias in favor of learning compositional meanings for new and explore conditions under which neural networks exhibit a bias towards learning mutually exclusive meanings for new data augmentation and inoculation have also been explored previously as a way to influence how models and show that small amounts of inoculating data during training on textual entailment help bert overlook certain surface study inoculation using a constructed language of numerical like they generate ambiguous though they only compare features that resemble our surface they find that it is relatively easy to nudge models away from shallow but harder to nudge them towards deeper several earlier studies explored how increasing training data impacts linguistic knowledge in unlike the present these studies evaluate lms using an unsupervised acceptability judgment task on minimal pairs and do not attempt to separate feature learning from feature find the greatest increase in sensitivity to acceptability contrasts occurs between training on and find that while lms learn agreement phenomena at a similarly early other phenomena require more data to find that adopting architectures that build in linguistic such as rnngs has a bigger effect on the acceptability task than increasing training data from to

unnumbered third level headings all including funding go end,this work builds upon the abstract model introduced by whose relevant aspects we briefly present let be a text and a function mapping a text to its semantic representation of the following the semantic representation is a probability distribution over semantic units many different text representation techniques can be topic models with topics as semantic or a properly renormalized semantic vector space with the dimensions as semantic in the summarization the source document and the summary are represented by probability distributions over the semantic and the background is represented as a distribution over semantic use and interchangeably when there is no is high whenever is a summary scoring can be derived from simple where captures the redundancy in the summary via the entropy reflects the relevance of the summary via the divergence between the summary and the a good summary is expected to be similar to the original the kl divergence should be models the informativeness of the summary via the kl divergence between the summary and the latent background knowledge the summary should bring new the kl divergence should be since the dependency on the document is never we drop it from the notation and simply use instead of the explicit in this we fix and focus on word distributions as representations for texts as in previous works

knowledge graph,in this work is mainly related to the following three lines of language this task strives to build linguistic representations benefiting various downstream in terms of model one line of research focuses on autoregressive while the other centers on denoising autoencoding as the core representative work of ar includes elmo and which aim to predict the next word based on previous tokens in a unidirectional pattern but lack the modeling of bidirectional xlnet remedies this with generalized ar based on permutation language but it enlarges the training the other research line is built upon which strives to reconstruct the original sequence based on the corrupted input by jointly attending to both the left and right the related endeavors share the same model architecture with the core difference being main efforts focus on for both bert and roberta adopt mlm to recover the masked or structbert attempts to incorporates word structure by restoring each shuffled token to its correct electra presents a more efficient approach by partially replacing the original input by the sequence from the dae introduces the noise discarded on downstream tasks during which is prone to learn representations covariant with the input leading to the these approaches neglect the modeling of global semantics of the others address this problem by incorporating supervision signals regarding the representation of entire segments through tasks most ar and dae based tasks neglect the modeling of global semantics of the some dae based approaches address this problem by incorporating supervisions regarding the entire segment through tasks or adjacent sentence such training relies heavily on the relative position of which suffers from excessively loose semantic it tends to result in confusing gradient in denoising autoencoding is prone to learn representations that are covariant with the input noise of in our capt encourages the semantic consistency of the original sequence and its corrupted version via unsupervised contrastive this not only alleviates the but also better captures the global semantics of the this research direction aims to build generic representation models for recent work has led to significant improvement on tasks by following the recent work typically involves extracting roi features and bounding box information with systems using learning to train a model on and then transferring it to downstream for uniter and are targeted at learning all of them use roi features and bounding box information as visual which are obtained through an object detection system such as faster in terms of model one representative research line focuses on for both vilbert and lxmert first encode visual and textual features by two separate the transformer layers are introduced to allow visual representations to attend to the texts and vice vilbert and lxmert proposed a architecture where image features and texts are first encoded by two transformers transformer layers are then introduced to allow the image representations to attend to the texts and vice by the other line such as uniter and strives to learn generic representations with a unified they usually combine visual and textual information for by projecting them into a common embedding the fused representations are then fed into a single transformer like bert to produce the this direction attempts to build generic representation models for in terms of model one research line focuses on which strives to learn generic representations with a unified the corresponding representative work includes they usually first combine visual and textual information by projecting them into a common embedding the fused representations are then fed into a single transformer to produce the in the other line such as vilbert and lxmert focuses on the they first encode visual and textual features by two separate the transformer layers are introduced to allow visual representations to attend to the textual representations and vice thus they can adapt to the needs of different input processing for each modality and better capture the interactions between multiple as for different work exhibits all focusing on and several specific tasks most of these tasks are prone to learning noise covariant representations in the compared with these our capt benefits the model to learn noise invariant representations via semantic contrastive thereby bringing better model contrastive learning is a branch of unsupervised representation which has been widely used in learning graph word representations and structured world the main idea is to construct pairs of related data as positive samples and pairs of unrelated data as negative and then learn to classify them via the contrastive the contrastive loss can come in several including noise contrastive and it serves as an unsupervised objective to learn feature embeddings where representations of positive samples are concentrated and negative representations are as distant as inspired by these we adapt contrastive learning to the natural language and domains to learn noise invariant sequence representations and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving massive contrastive learning is a branch of unsupervised representation the goal of which is to learn generic embedding features preserving the signals of the input while stripping off the it serves the purpose of reducing the dimensionality of the alleviating the scarcity of labeled data and producing representations that can be transferred to downstream the idea is to learn a feature embedding where representations of positive examples are concentrated and representations of negative examples are as distant as various pretext tasks and optimization objectives have been designed to achieve this instance discrimination task treats each instance as a distinctive class and connects the objective with classification loss or mutual information between input data and learned this task is subject to high computational cost due to the large number of instances in the training in many techniques have been introduced to tackle this such as approximating the full softmax distribution and improving efficiency using a memory bank or momentum another commonly used pretext task aims at learning features that are invariant to data augmentation methods or related efforts usually construct positive pairs by transforming the input data using different rules and feed the pairs into a siamese they then train this network by minimizing the contrastive maximizing mutual information or using other tasks include autoregressive future prediction which is employed in contrastive predictive coding along with a loss based on nce called contrastive learning has been widely used in learning word representations and structured world models without some work also uses contrastive learning in a supervised for proposed to adapt contrastive learning to the task of image captioning to encourage distinctiveness between input where true pairs are regarded as positive examples and mismatched pairs are considered negative

remains challenging worth,various approaches have been proposed to extract event early attempts to temporal relation extraction include which utilized machine learning methods and features for each pair of early effort focused on characterizing event pairs based on various types of semantic and linguistic and utilizing statistical learning such as logistic regression and svm to capture the whereas explored causal relation extraction by discovering patterns and employing various classification those methods typically require extensive feature and do not comprehensively consider the contextual information and global constraints among methods have been developed for temprel and have offered promising addressed this problem using a system combining an lstm document encoder and a siamese perceptron encoder for temporal commonsense knowledge from proposed a bidirectional lstm with structured prediction to extract both of these works incorporated global inference to facilitate constraints on with contextual representations learned through neural we develop an integrated joint learning process instead of employing hierarchy besides a couple of efforts have focused on event hierarchy subevent relation this task seeks to extract the hierarchy where each parent event contains child events that are described in the same to cope with this both and introduced a variety of features and employed logistic regression models for classifying event pairs into subevent relations and no relation followed their work by creating a more comprehensive set of features for events including discourse and narrative further extended the characterization with more features on the discourse and narrative presented a method by a time bert on corpora of time and used the estimation of time duration to predict subevent seek to address the problem of event sequencing sequencing involves clustering events into ordering events in the same and identifying subevent links between event with a decoding another line of work focuses on the extraction of subevents by noticing that subevents are commonly mentioned in sentences that refer to the source of information or simply in quotation though it is feasible to find subevents in this it provides few clue for hierarchical relations these patterns cannot help find the parent of extracted subevents in the aforementioned kind of sure what this though the method by has achieved decent results on two benchmark using large amount of they did not provide detailed analysis unveiling the importance of features they the linguistic and features used in the model may fail to capture cues and contextualized information of an in different though previous efforts have been devoted to preserving logical consistency through inference or structured this is difficult to do in the context of neural while it is a common strategy to combine multiple training data in learning our work is distinguished by enhancing the learning process by pushing the model towards a coherent output that satisfies logical constraints across separate note that limited efforts have been devoted to enforce the logical constraints in the training phase of relation extraction few have investigated the feasibility of combining and mutually enhancing the constrained learning process of multiple relation extraction these are exactly the focuses of this we also incorporate common sense knowledge from temprob and multiple constraints imposed by the nature of i said in the this is not we need to say that structured learning has done but this was

effectiveness joint constrained learning framework nlu view,text classification is dual to text classification since the features which capture the style of a document are mainly independent of its topic writing style is a combination of consistent decisions at different levels of language production including and structural associated to a specific author text classification was introduced by et the authors used basic stylistic features to classify news documents based on the corresponding publisher as well as text genre computational stylometry has a wide range of applications in literary science forensics and psycholinguistics syntactic are shown to achieve promising results in different stylometric tasks including author profiling and author verification in raghahvan et investigated the use of syntactic information by proposing a probabilistic grammar for the authorship attribution and used it as a language model for classification a combination of lexical and syntactic features has also been shown to enhance the model sundararajan et argue although syntax can be helpful for authorship combining syntax and lexical information can further boost the performance for attribution and attribution further studies which combine lexical and syntactic features include with recent advances in deep there exists a large body of work in the literature which employs deep neural networks

cased version,and data bridging the gap between unstructured natural language data and querying has been a theme in database the work on information extraction has developed techniques for translating segments of natural language text into triples that can be further processed by a database wikidata itself is a social experiment where additions to the knowledge graph are encouraged to use already existing relation names if thereby alleviating the need for information there has been significant work on translating queries posed in natural language into sql queries on a database whose schema is with extensions to data and knowledge more systems such as and have trained models to translate a natural language query into a sequence of relational operators s do not try to map data or queries into a at the we use neural techniques to process the facts in the database with the query given as context in natural s do some rudimentary analysis of the query when they decide whether it requires an aggregation and one can imagine that s will need more sophisticated understanding of the structure of a query as they tackle more complex the processing performed by the neural spj operator is reminiscent of information extraction in the sense that it produces a structured representation of facts that can be used by subsequent a key difference is that the extraction performed by the neural spj is query dependent and is independent of any with similar goals in the information retrieval community has developed search engines to answer sql the work most close to explores the problem of answering queries from a collection of xml documents that exhibit heterogeneous and hence are cumbersome in languages such as xpath or another similar research line is that of whang et similarly to what we propose they also support natural language queries but they still exploit to answer queries such papers about      oud computing  published after in digital whereas in our to solve this query the system needs to what are the relations and attributes that need to be used and the relative operators at the same time ir techniques are used to retrieve the initial set of potentially relevant answering from the nlp community has made great strides recently on the problem of answering queries from which includes tasks such as question answering and fact to efficiently scale machine comprehension to very large the nlp community adopt either a pipelined or jointly trained architecture of information retrieval with neural like many of these works answer questions using an explicit memory of knowledge in addition to the language these works typically require extracting a span from a single document or predicting a token or label as an whereas s require combining multiple performing selections and while have been made to perform discrete reasoning over passages with explicit computation these use only a single passage rather than requiring aggregation over large numbers of question answering is a recent setting where answering a query requires finding supporting evidence in multiple documents in solving the works either decompose the question into simpler sub or condition each hop on the previously retrieved some of these ideas inspired the design of the ssg in transformers have been shown to perform when provided with simple propositional in that transformers were able to join a small number of facts and rules of the form the squad dataset has been very popular in recent years for developing models that are capable of finding the answer in a note that this is a much harder task in comparison with the multiple choice qa as the number of choices for spans in the text is quadratic in the number of words present in the in an abstractive or generative question answering the model reads one or more passages and answer the question by generating one word at a time question answering is a type of question answering task where the answer can be selected from a list of possible mctest is a dataset that is based on multiple choice where each accompanying passage is a short another very common type of qa is extractive question when an extractive qa system is presented a question and a it is tasked with returning a segment from the passage which answers the the rankine cycle is sometimes referred to as a practical carnot what is the rankine cycle sometimes practical carnot in our we have a combination of answer multiple choice extractive john works at cusac gold mines for which company does john cusac gold mines and abstractive such as counting questions how many people in the database live in while other works modeling the web as a knowledge bases have focused on combining multiple snippets of text together their assumption is that the query is decomposed into a sparql program that is executed on our innovation is that no latent program or structure is needed and that information extraction is dynamic and dependent on the ir db perspective neural architectures to reasoning in the same spirit to neural turing machines and memory networks an alternative way of building is to encode all the facts in the database to a neural memory and build machinery to and reason on top of this neural such an approach would not have control and it is challenging to remove facts from the database or check whether a particular fact it would not be possible to explain query these architectures perform well on babi tasks where the number of facts is and mainly lookup or simple reasoning is in our experiments in they could not perform we hypothesize that encoding the query and facts together by a stack of in the encoder is necessary to answer database there also have been considerable efforts in mixing traditional symbolic reasoning or data management algorithms with neural network for et have developed a differentiable version of the backward chaining algorithm that drives most closely to our minervini et has showed how differentiable prolog interpreters can be used to support reasoning with facts in natural instead of existing symbolic in our work we start off with a scalable neural and support it with symbolic computation only where this enables us to directly leverage the rapid progress made in retrieval augmented qa models and ensures

text generation holistic,generation the work on narrative generation is split between cloze and guided in a cloze a full story except for the final word or sentence is and the model completes this could be cast as a short generation more commonly in this a problem generation is when the model generates a story conditioned on a prompt create a paired prompt and response dataset from the subreddit to train a extends but uses small and performs a decoding parameter we focus on this narrative generation task in our but primarily focus on medium and on performing parameter sweeps over nucleus sampling and diverse decoding guided generation is the middle ground of cloze and the model is provided more such as plot and potentially other and then generates a story based on all of the provided structural and semantic information methods for decoding refers to the inference methods used in natural language given input sequence how should we construct the output sequence since finding the exact most probable token at each time step often does not produce or results search and sampling are used to induce more stochasticity and thus generate more one popular search method is beam search where at each time the algorithm keeps track of the top most probable partial when this method reduces to the greedy which chooses the argmax over the model token distribution at each time an alternative to search are which select a token with likelihood proportional to a probability distribution at each time such methods include which restricts the sampling space to the top most probable tokens at every time and referred to as which thresholds the cumulative token probability distribution according to a hyperparameter we focus on nucleus as it has tended to be a more effective decoding method in various response generation settings an approach to control sampling is temperature which modifies the softmax estimating the token probability this has been applied widely in neural text generation especially when using or random low temperatures bias the model toward which tends to increase generation quality while decreasing token diversity temperature sampling has been investigated extensively in natural language generation over multiple sampling and nucleus sampling has been found to be a more effective method of controlling the sampling distribution so we do not investigate this in chatbot response and nucleus sampling have been known to generate but uninteresting and simple responses which do not address the input this issue is commonly referred to as the do not where the response to all inputs is often the phrase do not research has been done to address response specifically by altering the decoding some recent work in this domain includes who use inverse token frequency to reweight generated and use adversarial loss to optimize for and another approach explores variants of the standard applying different objectives during an example of this is maximum mutual information an objective that promotes more diverse responses in the neural response generation this mitigates the do not problem in which all responses tend to converge to some sequence with no real content conveyed in response to the input two versions are introduced in bidirectional and an model the typical decoding objective is defined as where is a target sequence is the output and is the input source we use a slightly modified form of the defined as where is a hyperparameter corresponding to the degree to which the language modeling objective should be subtracted from the sequential transduction this diverse decoding objective has been applied to response but has not yet been applied to the narrative generation in this we evaluate the effect of the objective on narrative generation

then automatically translated the to prevent unreadable proposed the method to predict the machine translation quality for sentences in a source and then generate a summary based on the predicted quality score before extended machine translation models to select important indicated that we should use information from both sides rather than such pipeline recent studies applied a neural model to generate abstractive summaries from the given document to construct pseudo abstractive summarization data for adopted the approach consisting of two machine translation of a document in the source language and then monolingual abstractive summarization of the translated they used the pairs of summarized translations and the original documents as pseudo training used genuine summaries to improve the quality of constructed training they applied a machine translation model to source sentences in monolingual pairs and used the pairs of translated sentences and genuine summaries as pseudo training proposed a translation strategy to obtain high quality pseudo training data from existing monolingual summarization their strategy translates a source sentence in monolingual pairs in the same manner as and then the translated sentence into the source their approach filters out based on the similarity between the source sentence and these studies explored the sophisticated way to construct pseudo training data but pay little attention to the existing genuine parallel in this study utilizes such genuine parallel corpora in addition to constructed pseudo data with the learning in addition to the translation introduced a learning approach for abstractive their method prepares two one for abstractive summarization and the other for machine translation or monolingual the method trains the decoders to generate corresponding output for a given they indicated that their learning approach improved the performance of abstractive summarization but it requires additional

the and in this usecase we get additional labeled data for one of the minority classes but the label space does not an effective solution in such a case could be to retrain the network from scratch but doing so requires time and in this work we explore different incremental training regimes given a limited computational recently in the nlp community there has been a lot of work on and adapting representations these works use techniques like gradual unfreezing and adapters to adapt the network to a new propose recipes for this setting where we have to adapt to a new our work aims to build similar recipes but for the continual learning incremental training

bigram low syntactic attention easily identify decoder context source we believe approach power future analyses text generation,our work is related to previous works on nlp tasks for text human attention as well as gaze integration in neural network two key tasks in machine text comprehension are paraphrasing and while paraphrasing is the task of the same but with different summarization deals with extracting or abstracting the key points of a larger input though advances have helped bring machine comprehension closer to human humans are still superior for most while attention mechanisms can improve performance by helping models to focus on relevant parts of the the benefit of explicit supervision through human attention remains predicting what people visually attend to in images is a challenge in neuroscience and computer in contrast to most attention models for eye movement behaviors during reading are cognitive process models that do not involve machine learning but implement cognitive key challenges for such models are a limited number of rules and thus a difficulty to adapt them to different tasks and as well as the difficulty to use them as part of an trained machine learning one of the most influential cognitive models of gaze during reading is the reader model it assumes attention shifts to be strictly serial in nature and that saccade production depends on different stages of lexical that has been successful in explaining different effects seen in attention allocation during in attention models for text remain trained models on features including length and frequency of words to predict fixations and later extended their approach to also predict fixation the first work to present a model for fixation prediction on text used a linear crf a separate line of work has instead tried to incorporate assumptions about the human reading process into the model for the neural attention language model was trained with hard attention and assigned a cost to each fixation subsequent work applied the neat model to question answering showing effects on learned attention patterns that reflect human further approaches include sentence representation learning using surprisal and part of speech tags as proxies to human attention as a way to improve time complexity for nlp and learning saliency scores by training for sentence our work is fundamentally different from all of these works in that for the first combine cognitive theory and integration of human gaze data into neural network architectures has been explored for a range of computer vision were the first to use gaze as an additional input to the attention layer for image while used attention maps as an additional supervision for the attention layer for a visual question answering most previous work in nlp has used gaze as an input for syntactic sequence classifying referential versus use of reference key phrase or prediction of proposed to build a lexicon of gaze features given word overcoming the need for gaze data at test two recent works proposed methods inspired by learning to integrate gaze into nlp classification did not integrate gaze into the attention layers but demonstrated performance improvements by adding a gaze prediction task to regularize a sentence compression did not predict human gaze for the target task but used gaze from another eye tracking corpus to regularize their neural attention in stark our work is the first to combine a cognitive model of reading and a approach to predict human to directly integrate these predictions into the neural attention and to jointly train for two different tasks generative and classification

most important sentences in a to this the summarization task is typically formalized as a classification problem for neural each sentence will be assigned with a probability of whether it should be included in the output and sentences with the highest probabilities will be where is a and is because most summarization corpora only contain heuristics are often used to obtain an oracle summary for each for and employ a greedy approach that incrementally add one sentence to the and the sentence that can increase the rouge score with the entire summary the most will be selected at each it should be noted that there are also neural approaches that do not adopt this for directly maximize the likelihood of human summaries given selected sentences and formulate the extractive summarization task as a semantic text matching problem and achieve performance on almost all popular with the attention is usually adopted in current neural abstractive summarization where an encoder generates a context vector for each source sentence and a decoder then outputs a one target word at a while being conceptually neural abstractive summarization models can suffer from generating unfaithful to alleviate such a copy mechanism is introduced in the field of text which allows the model to learn to detect important words or phrases in the source side and directly copy them to the target side with certain current abstractive summarization model mainly utilize language for use the pretrained bert to initialize the encoder of summarization models and then the model on summarization pretrain a language

among models based on recurrent neural networks are more common than those built on convolutional neural network because the former models can more effectively handle long attention is easily integrated with rnns and as it allows the model to focus more on salient parts of the source text it can serve as a pointer to select words in the source text for copying in architectures that are constructed entirely of transformer can be adopted to capture global dependencies between source text and summary prior knowledge has proven helpful for generating informative and readable templates that are retrieved from training data can guide summarization process at the when encoded in conjunction with the source text song et show that the syntactic structure can help to locate the content that is worth keeping in the such as the main keywords are commonly used in chinese text when the decoder is querying from the source wang and ren use the keywords extracted by the unsupervised method to exclude noisy and redundant deng et propose a model that not only utilizes keywords in the decoding but also adds the keywords produced by the generative method into the vocabulary in the hope of alleviating out of vocabulary our model is drastically different from the above two models in terms of the way keywords being extracted and the most related works are in the field of neural machine in which many researchers resort to the assistance of on the source su et use an network to encode the an input graph that contains both word and xiao et apply the input to the transformer and generalize the lattice to construct at a subword to fully take advantage of attention in the nguyen et first partition input sequence to phrase fragments based on type and then allow each head to attend to either one certain type or all different types at the same in addition to the proposed by hao et also attends to syntactic phrases obtained from syntactic trees to enhance structure on the target when the decoder produces an unk symbol which denotes a rare or unknown luong et restore it to a natural word using a srinivasan et adopt multiple decoders that map the same input into translations at

via command stfloats,unsupervised natura language representation unsupervised learning has become a new paradigm for natural language representation on many nlp using unsupervised learning as has achieved recent related researches includes the use of larger unsupervised datasets and larger network structures to improve model other studies use knowledge distillation or adversarial learning to compress model parameters or accelerate model the success of these efforts has undoubtedly led to the use of learning for multimodal learning in this we emphasize that multimodal learning is essential for more accurate understanding of text by representing its visual the unsupervised learning model is used for the parameter initialization of the text encoder in this multimodal some studies have extended unsupervised natural language representation learning to the multimodal including and due to the great success of these studies often follow its parameters and network uses a transformer layer to extend the standard transformer this new network architecture uses two joint transformers to simultaneously model visual and linguistic further treats visual elements and text elements as one and directly uses a standard transformer to model its joint and uses cloze tasks for joint representation these studies have two problems in solving the problems raised in this in their the encoders of language features and visual features are this limits that the downstream tasks of the model must also be multimodal but we want to solve the plain text inference in the language feature encoder proposed in this paper is decoupled and encode the plain text the training of these models only considers joint task which leads to catastrophic forgetting when reasoning over the natural in this we propose the lifelong learning regularization to anchor the natural in this way we avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem when learning new visual learning via contrastive learning is widely used in tasks such as unsupervised image temporal and image contrastive learning has become a popular toolkit for this its core idea is to learn the representation to reconstruct of identify some part of the this goal was formalized to maximize mutual information between different pieces of because the mutual information is some approximations have been including and although these studies have not been directly applied to the data of some studies also focus on the multimodal their inference of text and other modalities are which makes it infeasible to represent text with visual knowledge when only text is used as consider the structured correlations between different and often treat the data of different modalities as some orthogonal since our problem is for learning over their matchings have a

from two approaches based on the use of methods based on the use of machine the machine learning based methods are more so we focus on surveying these methods in this some of the earlier works in hatespeech detection have applied a variety of classical machine learning algorithms their intuition is to do feature engineering then apply classification methods such as random and logistic the features are mostly scores or and can be combined with additional features extracted from the user account meta information and network structure those methods are suboptimal as they mainly rely on the quality and quantity of the recent works have used deep neural network architectures for hatespeech detection such as cnn rnn combining cnn with rnn or fine tuning a pretrained language models deep neural networks have attracted tremendous attention from the research community as they can automatically learn the latent representations from raw input which can be seen as latent in the hatespeech detection recent works have used neural networks to classify hatespeech sequences using different neural architectures such as cnns rnn or combining cnn with rnn another direction in the domain of hatespeech classification focuses on the testing generalization of the current hatespeech classifiers where those methods are tested in other datasets and domains such as twitter data wikipedia data formspring data and youtube comment data unlike previous we a hateful language then build a hatespeech classifier with regularized adversarial training to enhance the model in this we aim to improve the performance of hatespeech using language modeling and a large scale dataset consists of content from yahoo news and yahoo to our this is the largest dataset for hatespeech classification inspired by the recent success of the bert model we exploit the bert architecture to enhance the performance of our hatespeech the lowest configuration of the pretrained bert model still has a lot of parameters which is not only expensive in terms of and memory to but also expensive during the inference we construct our proposed model with a much smaller number of parameters and perform even better than the version of the bert not pretraining distil bert on ground information on number of parameters in the statistic more experiments on the transfer and the running time

the our work leverages two critical components from the natural language processing in this we review previous approaches based on these two essential elements extensively used for this neural machine translation models and our study extensively leverages two critical components from the natural language processing in this we discuss previous studies by concentrating on these two neural machine translation and meta based on the success of neural machine translation models achieve significant performances in numerous language even showing the performance of nmt models depends on a size of parallel sentences from the source and target to address this diverse approaches have been which are categorized into two different utilizing monolingual and transferring the knowledge from domain to the recent studies point out the difficulty of gathering the parallel data abundant for machined translation whereas the monolingual datasets are relatively easy to focused on this many research attempt to handle this issue by only using monolingual datasets or adding small set of parallel dataset with the monolingual to facilitate monolingual several studies apply dual and pretraining the model with the bilingual as a more challenge nmt models only access monolingual as a challenging recent studies propose the unsupervised neural machine translation methods without using any parallel these algorithms extend algorithm and incorporate embedding owing to methods for a good such as the shared byte pair encoding and the cross lingual the unmt models show the compatible performances compared with the supervised nmt by extending the method and incorporating the methods for good such as the shared byte pair encoding and the the unmt models show comparable following the ones of the supervised this approach assumes that the models requires plenty of monolingual data or the parallel these approach assume to train the models with the abundant monolingual corpora or the parallel these approaches assume that the model can be trained by the abundant monolingual datasets for a target domain or parallel corpus when we intend to create a translation system into a particular language in a particular there may be fewer languages in the domain you want to translate even monolingual in this                         monolingual data        parallel data   monolingual data                         parallel dat  supervised learning          monolingual data  monolingual copora         pseudo parallel other studies concentrate on transferring the knowledge of the rich resources corpora into the many researches focused on improving language pairs in language round trip approach makes the model to learn several language pairs into a single and incorporate additional parallel data as pivot language to improve the source and target this approach exploits the and the corpus for transfer other approaches share the parameters of whole or part of the model across the languages when the model is difficult to collect pivot languages domain adaptation of neural machine translation by lexicon induction instead of recent researches reveal the problem of sensitive of domain when training data of a objective corpus is a so that we exploit other domain this problem motivated by this there are two which are and approaches attempt to incorporate the the domain discriminator and domain approaches generate synthetic parallel corpora from monolingual corpus after training on high resources parallel in most of the previous works with regard to the transfer learning has two characteristics as the model is jointly trained on the rich sources domain and the and one of the corpora or a corpus includes paired sentences between the source and target language at a few other studies concentrate on transferring the knowledge from the corpora into the such studies has two characteristics as follows the model is jointly trained on the rich sources domain and the and one of the corpora or a corpus includes paired sentences between the source and target language at owing to transferring the knowledge from rich some models show better performances than when trained with the corpora in spite of the improvements by the transfer learning these approaches still need the parallel corpus for the target or source domains and do not fully perform when both the and parallel datasets are these approaches apply in constraint which are one or both of target domains or source domain corpus are the parallel for if we intend to create a translation system of a particular language in a particular there may be fewer sentences as far as parallel data is to address this to address the above we define a new task as the unsupervised domain adaptation on the our work is a more challenging one than any other previous because we apply in both the corpus and the corpora as monolingual to the best of our our work is a more challenging scenario than any other previous because we apply in both the corpus and the corpora as monolingual our work is a first attempt to solve the unsupervised domain adaptation for the unsupervised machine domain adaptive dialog generation via meta learning for natural language generation in dialogue systems fast context adaptation via maml representations for continual learning as increasing the training machine learning methods show significant performances in a in we face a problem such as building the machine learning model in scare dataset in this the model is easily overfitted and fails to solve the to address this recent researches make an effort to adapt to a new task with only a few training in this meta learning approaches attract a solution by quickly and accurately adapting to a and show impressive results in various in scarce dataset most of machine learning models are easily overfitted to the dataset and fail to find an appropriate to deal with the approaches seek how to adapt quickly and

explored the main contributions paper summarized the translation unsolved topic machine translation community although neural machine translation recently become dominant translation paradigm provides superior independence sentences still fundamental assumption taken granted nmt this phenomena sentences pronominal consistent lexical verbal addressed nmt systems the current nmt approaches tackling

system trained combination real synthetic data obtained consider proposed system trained using monolingual tendency community conclude context used mt model works regularisation noise compare several methods claim including additional information improve translation mostly due regularization effect rather contextual also compare architectures replacing real context random signal show random signals achieve level improvement real taken grain salt since solving along quite there many impact factors data metric used one issue ignored researches problem since phenomena sentences appear less although doubt metrics like bleu score capture complex relationships to get insights capacities dealing phenomena mt researchers use targeted evaluation scores like accuracy pronoun translation evaluate systems specific test suites contain complex discourse phenomena we introduced work exploration model regularization nmt encoder decoder parameters based importance previously learned tasks

language we achieve improvement reduced training reducing training we also showed method less effective original language modeling task used pretrain nmt encoder different task learned we plan investigate whether gain improvements using different pretraining method encoder much task mismatch relates learning capacity,the or translation is a and unsolved topic in the machine translation community although neural machine translation has recently become the dominant translation paradigm that provides superior the independence between sentences is still the fundamental assumption taken for granted by most nmt this that phenomena between sentences such as pronominal consistent lexical and verbal can not be addressed by these nmt systems the current nmt approaches tackling discourse phenomena can be roughly categorized into three augmenting nmt by to include the concatenate consecutive sentences as input to the nmt while use an additional encoder to extract contextual information from a few previous these works only consider a local including a few previous some researches seek to capture the global document summarize the global context from all previous sentences in a document with a hierarchical rnn and then use it for updating decoder very proposed a discourse encoder that takes account of the discourse structure information of the input for adding additional conduct decoding and observe only a minor apply models to store vector representations for both and augment their nmt system with an external cache to memorize the translation integrate two hierarchical attention networks in the nmt model to take account for source and target apply a hierarchical attention module on sentences and words in the context to select contextual information that is more relevant to the current for incorporating monolingual data from the source use bert to model the context and integrate it with the encoder and decoder of the nmt share the parameters of a encoder trained on monolingual documents with the mt to utilize the monolingual data from the target also submit a system that trained on the combination of real and synthetic data obtained by they do not consider proposed a system which is trained only using the monolingual there has been a tendency in the community to conclude that the context used in a mt model works as regularisation or noise compare several methods and claim that including this additional information can improve translation but it is mostly due to the regularization effect rather than the contextual also compare some architectures by replacing the real context with some random signal and show that random signals can achieve the same level improvement as the real it should be taken with a grain of salt since solving this along with the is quite there are many impact factors from the the data at to the metric being used for one issue that can not be ignored in all researches is the problem of since some phenomena between sentences appear less although there is doubt if the metrics like bleu score can capture these complex relationships to get more insights into the capacities dealing with phenomena of their mt some researchers use more targeted evaluation scores like the accuracy of pronoun translation or they evaluate their systems on some specific test suites that contain more and more complex discourse phenomena

show model better generalized new,temporal graph extraction introduced the task of temporal graph extraction as ultimate task for evaluating an system that goes from raw text to timeml called it the evaluation still relied on a set of events from the timebank leading most of the teams to focus on relation notable systems developed in response include followed by the more recent cogcomptime and both and use several statistical and methods like event dependency semantic role and time expression identifiers for the assembles a sieve of systems and classifiers to extract dense temporal graphs from a given the graphs generated by are extremely with a relation extracted for every three words in the and an event extracted for every ten extracts simple verbs as without any as discussed large numbers of verbs extracted by are secondary to the main with about being is a sieve of and statistical where the systems are the statistical sieves were trained on a small corpus of limiting its our work differs from these systems in both the methodology and desired result in the following instead of using specialized we transform the task into a mapping problem and use a single language model to generate such temporal graphs in an fashion from subsuming all the we are interested in building a single system that can generate the temporal graphs in an we adapt language models to generate such temporal graphs automatically from the subsuming all the we develop our system using a corpus of which is larger compared to datasets used by and in we use a larger we remove the noisy events included by but do not limit the extracted events to any specific semantic axis as done by and our method generates graphs where the nodes are not simple verbs but augmented event containing the subject and the object of each besides relying on an intricate arrangement of they have some common they either admit a lot of noisy events or ignore events from the secondary narrative generate verbs as without adding any have limited generalization capabilities by way of relying on rules or small training we use over to generate a corpus for our task and to evaluate our two factors informed our we found to be much more a critical feature for our task of annotating close to verbs from its giving us the flexibility to filter out noisy events without inadvertently missing out on any critical our method makes no assumption specific to and is adaptable to any other similar system the dataset used for the development of is like major temporal finds its roots in the pioneering timebank which also spawned the development of the corpora developed for the tempeval tasks which proposes a dense annotation scheme to improve the coverage of temporal relations extracted from a which focuses exclusively on the start time of the events for assigning temporal has recently emerged as a popular choice for benchmark evaluations of temporal relation extraction we make no annotation specific assumptions in our and our methods are agnostic to any particular annotation we note that the problem of temporal graph extraction is different from the more popular task of temporal relation extraction which deals with classifying the temporal link between two already extracted a temporal graph generation system needs to perform the state of the art temprel systems use neural but typically use a handful of documents for their development and are a notable exception by using amazon mechanical turks to obtain manual annotations over a larger dataset of we believe that the techniques presented in our work can be applied to scale the corpus used for training temprel language models for graph generation the task of generating graphs using language models has gained a lot of proposed a system that on commonsense knowledge graphs like and for commonsense kb unlike traditional knowledge each node in a commonsense knowledge graph is a phrase or a transforming commonsense kb completion to a problem of conditional text each node in a commonsense knowledge graph is a phrase or a commonsense kb completion is naturally a problem of conditional text for given x acts quickly and a relation like because x a potentially valid would be x wanted to finish the input to consists of a node in the knowledge graph and and the expected output is a node that appears in similar we adopt language models for such a conditional generation of our task differs from in the complexity of both the conditioning text and generated we seek to generate temporal graphs conditioned on a whereas generates a short phrase conditioned on a relation and an input unlike our large commonsense knowledge bases that can readily be consumed by systems like are other popular graph generation techniques employ a vae and dependent decoding formulate graphs as a sequence for learning generative models of synthetic and similar to their we formulate graph generation as an our goal is the conditional generation of temporal and not learning unconditional generative inspired by recent we do not make any graph specific modifications to the model or the decoding process and formulate the problem as a straightforward mapping while our approach does not rely on any particular language it would be interesting to see the gains achieved by the much larger on the dataset produced by our available for research as of september show that typically helps the end task regardless of the and thus we believe that the methods presented are helpful irrespective of it would be interesting to use with large commercial models like as in we treat the entire graph as single sequence leverage the expressivity offered by large language different from all these our goal is the conditional generation of temporal and not learning unconditional generative we cede this exploration to future salient

machine translation shown impressive progress recent neural architectures greatly contributed especially languages abundant training this progress creates novel challenges evaluation machine human automated evaluation both types evaluation play important role machine while human evaluations provide gold standard involve fair amount careful hence expensive work human cost therefore limits scale

bridging nowadays used modern mt,collecting human paraphrases of existing references has recently been shown to be useful for system our work considers applying the same methodology for system there is some earlier work relying on automated paraphrases for system especially for statistical machine translation introduced an automatic paraphrasing technique based on translation of full sentences using a statistical mt and showed that this permitted reliable system tuning using half as much similar automatic paraphrasing has also been used to augment training but relying on standard references for in contrast to human the quality of current machine generated paraphrases degrades significantly as overlap with the input this makes their use difficult for evaluation since suggests that substantial paraphrasing as much as is necessary for our work can be seen as replacing the regular bleu metric with a new paraphrase bleu metric for system different alternative automatic evaluation metric have also been considered for system tuning with minimum error rate mert this work showed some specific cases where translation error rate was superior to our work is also related to the bias that the human translation process introduces in the including source language well as the professional translation community studies both systematic biases inherent to translated texts as well as biases resulting specifically from interference from the source text for point at translationese as a source of mismatch between bleu and human raising concerns that metrics might reward hypotheses with translationese language more than hypotheses using more natural the impact of translationese on human evaluation of mt has recently received attention as more the question of bias to a specific reference has also been in the case of monolingual manual evaluation different from the impact of translationese on the impact of translationese in the training data has also been our work is also related to studies measuring the importance of the test data looking specifically at the test set translation for smt and explored how the translation direction affects translation noted that the original language of the test sentences influences the bleu score of they showed that the bleu scores for sentences are on average higher than sentences that have their original source in a different

learning models over relational data has attracted considerable attention in the machine learning in this we survey several lines of work dealing with neural and hybrid representations for relational the difficulty of building complex machine learning models over relational data has attracted considerable attention in the machine learning community and several high level languages for specifying graphical models have been blog and church were suggested for generative for discriminative we have markov logic networks and probabilistic soft logic both psl and mlns combine logic and probabilistic graphical models in a single where each formula is associated with a and the probability distribution over possible assignments is derived from the weights of the formulas that are satisfied by such like psl uses formulas in clausal form the main difference between and these languages is in addition to graphical it uses distributed knowledge representations to represent other discriminative methods include an imperative language to define factor constraints conditional models an interface to enhance linear classifiers with declarative and proppr a probabilistic logic for large databases that approximates local groundings using a variant of personalized graph node joint relational embeddings a recent alternative to graphical models is to use neural nets to represent and learn over relational represented as a similar to the learned node representation can be trained by several different prediction unlike these methods do not use probabilistic inference to ensure node embeddings approaches learn a feature representation for nodes capturing graph adjacency such that the similarity in the embedding space of any two nodes is proportional to their graph distance and overlap in neighbouring some frameworks allow nodes to have textual which provide an initial feature representation when learning to represent the graph when dealing with such as knowledge both the nodes and the edge types are embedded these methods learn to represent nodes and relations based on node without representing the broader graph context in which they graph neural nets create contextualized node representations by recursively aggregating neighbouring several recent systems explore ways to combine neural and symbolic representations in a unified we group them into five lifted rules to specify compositional these systems use an approach and learn relational dependencies in a latent lifted relational neural networks and relnns are two these systems map observed ground facts and rules to specific neurons in a network and define composition functions directly over while they provide for a modular abstraction of the relational they assume all inputs are symbolic and do not leverage expressive that focus on differentiable these systems identify classes of logical queries that can be compiled into differentiable functions in a neural network in this space we have tensor logic networks and tensorlog symbols are represented as row vectors in a parameter the focus is on implementing reasoning using a series of numeric that focus on rule rule induction from these systems are designed for inducing rules from symbolic knowledge which is not in the scope of our in this space we find neural theorem provers neural logic programming drum and neural logic machines ntps use a declarative interface to specify rules that add inductive bias and perform soft the other approaches work directly over the deep classifiers and probabilistic these systems propose ways to integrate probabilistic inference and neural networks for diverse learning deepproblog extends the probabilistic logic programming language problog to handle neural they are able to learn probabilities for atomic expressions using neural the input data consists of a combination of feature vectors for the neural together with other probabilistic facts and clauses in the logic targets are only given at the output side of the probabilistic allowing them to learn each example with respect to a single we focus on encoding entities and on the other deep probabilistic logic combines neural networks with probabilistic logic for indirect they learn classifiers using neural networks and use probabilistic logic to introduce distant supervision and labeling each rule is regarded as a latent and the logic defines a joint probability distribution over all labeling the rule weights and the network parameters are learned jointly using variational in focuses on learning multiple interdependent decisions from handling and requiring supervision for all unknown atoms in a given deep logic models learn a set of parameters to encode atoms in a probabilistic logic similarly to and they use differentiable allowing the model to be trained like dlms can work with diverse neural architectures and backpropagate back to the base the main difference between dlms and is that ensures representation consistency of entities and relations across all learning tasks by employing our focus in this paper is highly noisy inputs such as text and social requiring us to employ powerful dlms experiments rely on simple encoders for raw data and symbolic inputs deep structured more deep structured prediction approaches have been successfully applied to various nlp tasks such as ner and dependency when the need arises to go beyond some works combine the output scores of independently trained classifiers using while others implement joint learning for their specific domains our main differentiating factor is that we provide a general interface that leverages fol clauses to specify factor graphs and express we have a principled way to build relational neural networks that allows us to include expressive encoders for raw entities works that focus on works that use lifted rules a way to specify compositional neural works that focus on inducing rules for symbolic knowledge more deep structured to summarize these we outline a feature matrix in given our focus in nlp we require a system that allows us to integrate text encoders and nlp supports structured prediction across long lets us combine several modalities and their representations and results in an explainable model where domain constraints can be easily the current state on nlp approaches for argumentative tasks like the ones we care several recent models attempted to take advantage of these complimentary strengths by combining different elements of these these models focus on different which can limit their applicability to certain problem or learning for propose a architecture for combining relevant relations designed for predicting entity suggest a graph embedding approach forcing relational inductive bias on the learned while the model suggested by focuses on learning tree structured in this paper we look into combining such declarative frameworks with deep learning combining deep learning with structured models has been studied in previous typically in the context of a specific task or a specific inference these include dependency transition named entity recognition and sequence labeling systems and argument mining researchers have revisited the insights of the integration community and explored more general frameworks to combine the best of both for introducing relational inductive biases to neural architectures using graph networks using logical rules to specify neural networks defining logical constraints over specific neurons and extending probabilistic programming to process neural

introduce mild inference speed proves efficiency,our work builds on research in wrapper induction in the data mining community and the contributions of neural models for information extraction tasks in the nlp we apply it in the context of modeling web documents with neural we aim to build a more lightweight yet transferable model by getting rid of expensive features and complex we discuss our work in the following three structured data structured data extraction from web documents has been studied extensively in supervised early works usually require a significant number of rules or labels for inducing a wrapper which is only used for a particular web these wrappers are usually brittle when testing on unseen websites in the same although they can have high precision and recall on the training some recent works propose methods that can adapt to new zhai et employed active learning methods that can find the most influential new examples in target websites for human annotators to and therefore adapting the existing wrappers to new sites in a cheaper in methods not only constantly require human effort in building specialized annotation tools but also need humans to label samples for each new site of a recent work by lockard et attempted to use additional knowledge bases as distant supervision to automatically label some samples in the target websites and then learn a machine learning model on such a large and comprehensive knowledge base is not always accessible and available for every their methods do not apply for emerging domains without first requiring the human effort of building a knowledge to address the problem in a more we do not impose any human prior knowledge on the and focus on a purely unsupervised model adaptation learning transferable extraction hao et proposed a method that was based on visual distance features on a rendered web this achieved promising results on unseen websites without using any new human following their there are a series of extraction models proposed for many different these methods need to download all the external files including css style javascripts and images such that they can render a page with browser engines to know page in they have to design heuristic algorithms for computing distance these drawbacks together make extraction less practical and our instead is totally based on the html content itself without any use of external resources or page when using two or more seed websites to outperforms even the approach with expensive features on one these methods need to download all the external files including css style javascripts and images such that they can further render a page with browser engines to know page to related other than they usually have to design heuristic algorithms to obtain useful visual features from human model transfer with neural networks neural architectures for information another advantage of our method is that it can work well without any features or we adopt sequence modeling techniques from ie and nlp to build our word xpath and position our network is inspired by the relational reasoning which learns to induce relational features between semantic units a similar idea of encoding as vectors also show promising results for reasoning about relations in natural language these together help us eliminate the need for human effort in both designing features and metric the learned neural features further make our model more recent advances in natural language processing also show an emerging interest in learning powerful deep neural features for richly formatted texts and our work agrees with the findings in neural networks can effectively replace features for extracting data in richly formatted to the best of our we are among the first approach using neural networks for learning to represent dom nodes in web pages to solve structured document modeling

style bibliography end file,  jour de avec papiers r   ents ne que citer les refers to the task of generating natural language descriptions from structured data models can be classified in two broad models and approaches first approaches are designed by domain expert the former approaches are driven by leading to a pipeline architecture split into content selection and text structuring sentence planning and generating actual sentences while accurate and efficient at inference these methods require significant manual efforts for new in approaches tend to blur the distinction between these subtasks with training on large corpora of aligned input data and output text methods have been proposed such as who apply statistical machine translation techniques to the sportcasting recent neural approaches now propose to leverage progress in deep learning to represent these data into a semantic vector space and stem from the neural machine translation domain and most work model the data records as a single sequence of facts to be entirely translated into natural for were the first to propose a neural language model conditioned on tabular where each word embedding was computed following both its place in a fixed and its eventual position in the tabular data being all subsequent work use the standard architecture propose the now by default with an attention mechanism which computes a context focused on important elements from the and a copy mechanism to deal with unknown or rare to address a common approach is to build architectures that explicitly model the structure of the input in to handle the need for content design a more complex which first generates a plan of elements from the source data to be and then conditions text generation on this additional work introduces dynamic encoding where the model updates part of the source data encoding at each decoding step in order to more accurately guide the decoder throughout explore a the proposed encoder has an added gate for field while the decoder uses dual where attention scores are computed on both field names and to form a final attention score via while these models produce fluent and several pathological behaviors have been echoing similar issues in other text generation tasks training neural model on tasks requires large corpora different pathological behaviors arise from the depending on the methodology underlying their for datasets crowdworkers sometimes fail to cover all information from the data source in reference automatically constructed datasets from possibly different internet sources do not guarantee data sources and texts to be aligned since they might have been taken from different raw that the reference texts are in data sources since they may contain additional for showed that more than of references in the wikibio dataset contain phrases not grounded in the associated both these limitations induce neural generation model to omit information in the first case or suffer from hallucinations in the to deal with these previous work operate either at the dataset or at the training at the dataset show that cleaned data can significantly improve system ability to produce in a different apply a method similar to knowledge distillation they train a natural language understanding module to reconstruct tables from text references and show that a vanilla model trained on the refined data has improved content correctness in both human and automatic when compared with the current at the training stemming from translation for propose to include a reconstruction loss aiming at reconstructing the source table from the hidden states of the they train their model with a loss computed as a combination of the loss on the target side and the loss on the input in an other propose a classifying neural trained to label text tokens depending on their alignment with the associated they use these labels in an rl framework to generate sentences with a maximum of aligned however these approaches are either costly in human labor or specific to datasets where the input data matches exactly the reference texts indeed reconstruction tasks are not compatible with the content selection subtask of proposing both a novel attention and a constitutes a first approach to a however their proposed coverage is still task specific while they increase the bleu on they underperfom models on the parent showing that bleu focused systems might not be until the nlg research community cruelly lacked ways to automatically evaluate model until recently there was no way to correctly automatically evaluate model despite work on effective human evaluation and on the need for better automated metrics to the best of our only and recently proposed improvement over the widely used propose to use an auxiliary neural trained to extract structured records from the generated text for two texts can then be compared through their sequences of extracted this information approach suffers from domain as the released model only works in the of basketball journalistic and requires precise tagging of gold references which can be impossible to provide in most propose a new metric and show that this metric strongly correlates with human annotators and can replace previous and information our contribution differs from previous work in several our proposed framework is and can be used with any neural instead of focusing on only one domain one issue it is setting agnostic and tackles both hallucinations and omissions at once by leveraging the parent no manual preprocessing or is models are trained via a flexible training protocol and distantiate themselves from faulty training

distant supervision method into relation classification which automatically acquires training data by aligning knowledge base and the dataset generated by this method has the relations that the former has drawn much attention of many propose a pcnn model with learning to filter out those negative but it ignores a large amount of information contained in these noise propose a model in order to consider all sentences including those many works use the reinforcement learning to automatically distinguish positive and negative such as many relations are and still suffer from data to address this first introduce learning to rc the learning paradigm has been proved effective in the computer vision community and has many earlier works on rc are based on the widely used learning model prototypical the language models has shown significant power in many natural language processing to this adopt the most representative lm bert to and their work shows that bert brings significant improvements on classification the approach proposed by are also based on bert and achieve the result on the rc previous rc models usually use the relative position information to identify which words

used to construct classifiers and engines to correct specific error types when using balancing the distribution of errors in the train and test sets has been shown to improve results ensembling systems relying on performance has been shown superior to each system performance and over average ensembling augmenting the training data with synthetic errors of a particular type is effective for improving performance on that type the classification of grammatical error types is also used to analyze system performance showed that current systems and evaluation measures essentially ignore some error suggesting that targeted evaluation of these types may be to several error taxonomies have been proposed and applied for annotating errors in major english corpora there has been interest lately in other for which different datasets and taxonomies were created different taxonomies are used by different based on commonly observed error types in the target domain and which impedes direct comparison across these taxonomies are not formulated based on a specific theory or annotation scheme for morphosyntactic which may promote accessibility to but often leads to terminology and difficulty in leveraging available nlp another automatic type classification was suggested apart from trained a model to predict types defined by this taxonomy resembles ours in that it uses grammatical categories but differs in that it only distinguishes types based on the pos tag of the correction and not of the source relying solely on pos tags yields difficulties in classifying constructions that involve more than a single for such it defines specialized error such as incorrect argument which serves as a residual category for argument structure errors that cannot be accounted for by adposition or agreement unlike it does not provide any information as to what particular incorrect argument structure was used or how it should be provides this additional information in the form of ud labels and pos used a semantic annotation to show unlike syntax is kept upon ud was previously used in gec in the tle corpus and in a learner language parser

produced using bibtex program suitable bibtex files the bibliography style file ieee produces unsorted bibliography,recent works in abstractive summarization have leveraged intermediate content in these writing a summary is factorized into two extraction and an extractor is used to prioritize and select the most important part of the input the extractor is normally trained on a sequence of binary labels where each label indicates whether the corresponding text unit should be selected or the level of extraction can be or as the ground truth for extraction is typically heuristics that measure overlap with the target summary are used to build extractive similar to other performs extraction to deal with long source preliminary we applied selection on the pubmed and arxiv which led to poor determines the alignment between source and target sentences in a latent space without relying on possibly suboptimal extractive in sentence extraction is not sequentially done in which addresses the exposure bias issue used a similar approach to create multiple types of sentence embeddings called structured sentence embedding different from their we use the matrix as an external memory block with number of slots to store a smaller set of sentence we further integrate the memory module with the baseline hred model for language in our the memory representation gets updated dynamically by the decoder while the structured sentence embedding matrix remains memory augmented encoder decoder architectures have been proposed for conditional natural language generation such as machine translation and image captioning using differentiable read and write operations to an external maed can represent context of rnns with enhanced memory such models are able to store temporally distant information of large input a feature that is particularly useful for long text in the context of short text abstractive proposed a memory architecture named memory networks mmn can flexibly reduce representations at different levels of document hierarchy into a fixed size external authors used dilated convolutional neural networks to build a hierarchical representation of the also constructs memory from the hierarchical representation of the but by compressing it into a sparse set of sentence mmn memory representations remain static throughout the decoding process while dynamically updates its which is more effective in learning long term lastly but not our work proposes novel regularization for memory read and original related work by jon recent work in deep learning has studied various new methods to augment neural networks with external memory using a continuous memory representation similar to neural turing machines or differentiable neural computer showed the importance of allowing multiple reads and writes to memory between inputs in language modeling further improved on such experiments by using an lstm language model equipped with a multihop adaptive continuous stack such memory mechanisms often read or write to a single memory not fully taking advantage of a memory ability to store distributed representations our memory mechanism is different since we first compress the sequence with that writes to all slots during we use a gating based writing mechanism that forces every slot to sequentially forget or input as we will show in the analysis our memory mechanism insures that memory slots are used to capacity and contain a diverse set of memory augmented encoder decoders have been proposed for conditional natural language generation such as machine translation and image captioning using differentiable read and write operations to an external maed can represent context of rnns with its larger memory such models are able to store temporally distant information of large input a feature that is particularly useful for large text on short text abstractive a memory network was proposed that can flexibly reduce representations at different levels of document hierarchy into a fixed size external we also reduce the hierarchical representation of the but by storing a sparse set of sentence as shown in each memory slot contains a much more focused set of sentence representations with the proper another difference is that we use the memory representations to calculate the conditional probability of the next word whereas only use memory representations to calculate attention in that our method is much closer to hybrid summarization models because the decoder relies on the stored representations in the the final and important difference is that our method can be attached to any type of hred and it does not use temporal convolutional networks which need parameter changes for different tasks or different datasets unified model for summ abstractive summarization of reddit posts with memory networks sentence simplification with neural networks memory based models have been used in several nlg using a continuous memory representation similar to neural turing show the importance of allowing multiple reads and writes to memory between inputs in language modeling further improved on such experiments by using an lstm language model equipped with a multihop adaptive continuous stack when experimenting with the multihop adaptive continuous stack memory for abstractive summarization in a hred used a gru with a stack memory on the sentence encoder and more details can be found in the we have found two issues only the top slots of the encoder stack memory were filled the decoder memory stack rarely used or mixed memories transferred from the other maed have been proposed for conditional such as machine translation image captioning qa in maed have been used on extractive summarization and on short text abstractive summarization these approaches excel at tasks where it is necessary to store some parts of a sequential input in a representation that can later be precisely we found however that most maed innovations focused on improving long term memories of the encoded input or in this we suggest solutions in these a memory creation mechanism that condenses the encoded input akin to an extraction a conditional mechanism that allows the decoder to encoder we propose another feature transfers memories from different the encoder memory stores input information while the decoder updates are conditioned on output

supporting facts data filtering approach balance distribution experiments hotpotqa dataset show models outperform current best approaches substantial margin bleu our analysis reveals components may critical improving render complementary strengths root,our work is closely related to three lines of neural topic models and learning disentangled probabilistic graphical models for topic extraction have been extensively a vast beyond lda a wide spectrum of models has extended lda to more specific tasks using contextual information is a supervised extension which builds on top of lda by adding a response variable associated with each document or a category of extensions particularly relevant for this work is the examples include the joint model and aspect and sentiment unification model these models are able to extract informative topics grouped under different sentiment although they do not rely on document they require word prior polarity information to be incorporated into the learning process in order to generate consistent about words and their because during each gibbs sampling iteration it has to repeatedly sample from the posterior of the pair assignment for each word token throughout the entire to address the above issues and to analyze sentiment and topic trends over a dynamic joint model was it derives an online inference procedure based on a stochastic expectation maximization algorithm to better fit larger and similarly to when provided with class jst can learn distributions influenced by the class the possibility to supervise the learning process with document labels and to avoid the necessity of prior information over words makes it suitable for a fair comparison with the model proposed in this these models require carefully tailored inference and the standard gibbs sampling algorithm used can have a high computational cost when fitting with time and memory scaling linearly with the number of leading researchers to devise more sophisticated approaches to make it scalable compared to the discussed sentiment topic models can only distinguish between topics and neutral remaining strictly aligned to the provided diatom is able to generate topics and plot topics which may still be polarized but not carrying any user compared to these diatom not only generates polarised topics but is able to separate them from polarised or neutral topics which however are not related to the target label neural topic neural models provide a more generic and extendable alternative to topic and have recently gained increasing some of them use belief networks or enforce the dirichlet prior on the distribution by means of wasserstein autoencoders others adopt continuous representations to capture dependencies or preserve word order via vae whose time complexity and difficulty of have limited their neural variational document model is a direct extension of vae used for topic detection in in the prior of latent topics is assumed to be a gaussian this is not ideal since it cannot mimic the simplex in the latent topic to address this instead used the logistic normal distribution to approximate the dirichlet prodlda extended by replacing the mixture model of lda with a product of which employs a laplace approximation to make the gradient to the variational is a neural framework for topic models with metadata incorporation without the need of deriving inference when metadata are document the model infers topics that are relevant to those although some studies have applied the adversarial approach to topic models setting a dirichlet prior on the generative network it is still unexplored how to use this mechanism to disentangle topics from plot or neutral topic as for the carried sentiment since is not based on variational we cannot compute the elbo based perplexity as a performance metric as compared to these neural topic diatom is the first attempt using an adversarial mechanism to distinguish between topic type while not only generating topics aligned with the available target labels but seamless incorporating the external signal of plot summaries to drive the generation of topics about salient parts of plots mentioned by users not related to the target classes representation despite the lack of general consensus about a unique definition of disentangled representations it typically refers to representations which are only sensitive to one single generative factor of data and relatively invariant to other factors of variation one proposed definition builds upon the concept of statistical independence by minimizing total correlation while an alternative approach explored the possibility to measure and track the changes in a single latent dimension as degree of disentanglement the disentanglement of representation achieved in diatom is instead analogous to the one presented in and where they impose additional constraints to the representations in the latent space that can be controlled exploiting a reinforcement learning mechanism determining the disentangled in we alternatively make use of an adversarial approach over the available target both generative adversarial networks and vaes have been successfully employed in disentangling features in computer vision application in text processing has shown promising results yet applications to topic modeling are still limited and to the best of our there is no work in separating topics from architecture

reached leaves little gained improving a interesting conclusion comparison dnn maximum entropy pretrained word embeddings improve maximum entropy model this likely results limited modelling capacity maximum entropy still benefits information brought pretrained but information precise enough shown qualitative analysis,in this we will introduce our baseline attention pointer generation these three models are closely related to our there has been a surge of work proposing to build the natural language generation within a it has great potential for various tasks in natural such as machine text the model usually uses rnn structure and has an encoder and a the role of the encoder maps the context to a and the task of the decoder is to convert this vector into the text to be we get the encoder hidden state of the contenxt through the in the each time step decoder received representation of original context information produce decoder state as shown in the represents the parameters to be learned during with attention we calculated we can get attention distribution it represent a probability distribution of source we can get context vector we will concatenated context vector and decoder hidden state through linear transformation get vocabulary distribution and represents the parameters to be learned during according to vocabulary probability distribution we get final distribution preict words unlike the the pointer generation networks uses the attention mechanism as a pointer to select token in the and then obtains an expanded vocabulary distribution beyond the original vocabulary we have got encoder hidden state decoder state decoder input context vector and attention distribution in section we need to calculate the generation probability at each time step the and are parameters which need the is sigmod in pointer generation wo through attention distribution and vocabluary distribution get expanded vocabulary in the the output sequence probability distribution from expanded vocabluary as shown is in the model will be selected to copy the word from context by attention distribution if the word will be generated not in the is transformer is a new network architecture which based solely on attention in order to deal with the problem that rnn cannot be there have been some solutions using such as google facebook proposed this model proposed a particular attention named scaled it is input consists of queries and keys of dimension and values of dimension this is a self attention it can be as a set of pairs to an the and are matrices of learning self attention can be computed the mechanism can connect information at different positions on the input and then calculate a certain expression of the entire and the reason for dividing by is that when the dimension of the key is particularly the dot product may become very causing the subsequent softmax function to enter a small gradient which is not conducive to in each word embedding we execute a attention mechanism in parallel and then concatenated and once again which is called the and are learnable because the transformer does not use any recurrence or convolution in order for the model to use the sequence information of the input some information that can express the absolute or relative position of each part of the input sequence must be the method adopted by the transformer is positional before entering the encoder and the input is the vector dimension after encoding is encoding using sine and cosine the is position and is the we compare the advantages and disadvantages of recurrence and convolutional structure from three the first is the computational complexity of each the second is the amount of computation that can be performed in and the last is the length of the path that the network depends on for a long the comparison shows that performs using transformers to be able to handle longer without recurrence structure and convolutional making

extension would include canceled deals predict novel events based market descriptions companies additional financial events yet another related task considered,recent advances in have spurred a surge of interests in adopting neural models to information many existing works adopt a pipeline approach that includes a retrieval stage and a reranking for where the task is to find the most relevant documents in a large document one line of research focuses on using neural networks to learn better term weighting to improve term retrieval one line of research investigates projecting query and documents into a shared dense space the models in this family are regarded as models or dual encoder this is the kind of model that we employ in this a query and its relevant documents should be projected in each other from this point of finding the most relevant documents can be cast to a nearest neighbor search previous attempts at improving the quality of dual encoder models can be classified into two the first type focuses on finding a good initialization for the model this is typically achieved by the model on various tasks in our strategy is based on synthetic query generation while the approach was originally proposed for we show that dual encoder models trained on supervised data can significantly improve when combined with synthetic question another type of approach focuses on learning better representations using hard this strategy has proved to be effective in passage retrieval tasks machine translation and entity linking these works mine hard negatives using different for mine negatives with a mine hard negatives using a and use a model trained with random negatives and select examples that are ranked above the correct one as negative our work systematically studies different hard negative mining todo neural networks have also become popular at the reranking this paper focus on the retrieval and leaves reranking as a future line of reranking stage is outside the scope of this it is nonetheless worth mentioning here as neural reranking is an important research since reranking only processes a small subset of candidates that are returned by it is possible to use models to capture the interaction between query and document and thus improve the discriminating power of the models using dense representation for passage or document retrieval is the search space may include millions or billions of retrieval some recent works adopt a pipeline approach consisting of two steps as a first the system retrieves a large number of passages using sparse encoding representations using techniques such as and deepct in a second it the passages using a neural this pipeline approach is hindered by error in powerful models such as bert can be used in the second step to jointly encode the pairs as this is not feasible in the retrieval in the first dual encoder models consist of a pair of encoders that encode questions and passages separately and score each pair by calculating the inner product of their this type of models shows strong performance on retrieval such as translation pair retrieval question answering its scalability makes it a good alternative for the retriever in the pipeline the scalability of the dual encoder models make them an appealing alternative for the first step retriever in the pipeline karpukhin et made the first attempt to use dual encoder models for ance proposes a training framework which collects negatives from an approximate nearest neighbor index of the which is updated in parallel to the model training

produces unsorted bibliography,targeted opinion word extraction is one of the of sentiment analysis while this task is relatively less in the other related including opinion target extraction or opinion word extraction has been early attempts for ote employed methods deep learning methods have been also exploited for this task for owe early work proposed models joint models to simultaneously predict the target and the opinion words have been explored joint models cannot pair up the opinion words and the in the are the early attempts to pair up the opinion words with the their methods is based on distance or syntax based this direction is continued by recent works while these methods employ deep learning for they ignore the syntactic information to pair the opinion words and the in this we propose a new deep learning method to efficiently employ the structure of the sentence for can extend this part for the related a notable problem is that although the related tasks of towe has been extensively explored in the there have been only a few work to explicitly consider the towe problem in the literature comparing to the related towe has been relatively less explored in the in the most related task of towe is opinion word extraction that aims to locate the terms used to express attitude in the sentences a key difference between owe and towe is that owe does not require the opinion words to tie to any target words in the sentence while the opinion words in towe should be explicitly paired with a given target another related task for towe is opinion target extraction that attempts to identify the target words in the sentences note that some previous works have also attempted to jointly predict the target and opinion words the target words are still not paired with their corresponding opinion words in these as mentioned in the among a few previous work on the main approaches include the methods and the recent deep learning models our model is different from the previous deep learning models as we exploit the syntactic information for towe with deep featuring both the models and deep learning models to solve this while the early model has shown syntactical structure is useful for recent deep learning models ignore this early models has shown that syntactical structure of the sentence is useful for more the application of dependency tree for towe is two pairwise word dependency tree is useful to infer the relative importance of a word toward another word in the same this relative importance could be helpful for towe to attend to the important words for the target to infer importance of two words using dependency one can computes the distance between two words in the dependency for as a running in the sentence warranties honored by hp are the opinion word is sequentially far from its target word in the dependency tree shown in figure the two words and are directly connected to each the short distance between these two words could be helpful to infer the importance of the word for the target word dependency tree could provide better contextual information for each word via the connections of the word with its head and thus it helps to improve word dependency tree could benefit for in the running the head of is while the head of is it would be easier to infer that the opinion word is related to the target word and is despite the usefulness of the dependency tree for recent deep learning approaches ignore this structural information in their models in order to address this in this we propose a deep learning model to utilize syntactic structure for more the proposed approach is able to explicitly encode both importance of the words and also to incorporate the word connections in the dependency how can we encode the importance scores of the words into a deep in this we propose to employ the importance scores to retain or update the information encoded in the representations of each in those words that are syntactically more important should retain more information in the computation graph of the deep model while the information about less important words should be discarded more in order to impose this information update policy in our we use the new proposed architecture long memory is an extension of the long memory with two additional gates these new gates are employed to control the frequency of updating each neuron across different time steps in the the values of the master forget and input gates determine how much information in the hidden vector of the lstm cell should be retained or updated based on the word at the current time one can infer the importance scores inferred by the model using the values of the master forget or input based on this characteristics of to encode the importance scores into our we propose to exploit the importance scores to regulate importance in training we encourage the scores to be consistent with importance in order to incorporate the word connections between words in the dependency tree into our we propose to utilize graph convolution network the dependency tree is a syntactic structure of the sentence and it is not tailored to this some of the connections between words might not be relevant to this task and thereby relying solely on the dependency tree could hurt the to overcome this we propose to combine dependency tree with a weighted dense the nodes of this graph are the words of the sentence and the weight of the edge between each pair of words is a function of the distance of the two words to the target word in the dependency as the weights in this dense graph are trainable and they are a function of the target this dense graph is more thus it could regularize the noisy connections in the dependency to distinguish the opinion words that are related to the given target from the other opinion we propose a new inductive bias to be imposed to the final loss this inductive bias encourage the model to regulate information flow in the gcn layer in a way that the related opinion words would propagate more information to other nodes than opinion our extensive experiments and analysis on four benchmark datasets prove the effectiveness of the proposed leading to the performance on all

review questions may concern about finding subjective personal experiences or opinions of certain products and the amazon qa dataset was first released in which contains million questions and million reviews on thousand products collected from amazon product they developed a mixture of expert model which automatically detects whether a review of a product is relevant to a given in their subsequent wan and mcauley noticed that users tend to ask for subjective information and answers might also be highly subjective and possibly built a new dataset with thousand questions and over million answers from in which each question is paired with multiple and extended their previous moe model with subjective information such as review rating scores and reviewer bias but they found that subjective information is only effective in predicting answers to binary questions and does not help in distinguishing answers from alternatives in more yu and lam only focused on the questions in the amazon qa dataset and trained a binary answer prediction model by leveraging latent representations of both questions and reviews learned by an gao et focused on factual qa in and proposed a answer generator that combines reviews and product attributes for answer and uses a discriminator to determine whether the generated answer contains xu et proposed an extractive qa task and manually created just over questions and annotated the corresponding answer spans in less than reviews relating to laptops and restaurants from the review data of semeval task they first jointly bert for answer span aspect extraction and aspect sentiment classification on the semeval task and then bert on over million unlabelled amazon and yelp reviews in order to fuse domain and also on squad in order to gain but gupta et created a subset from the amazon qa product review dataset consisting of questions with answers and reviews on amazon they trained an answerability classifier from pairs labeled by mechanical turk and used it to classify answerability for the whole they then converted the dataset into a format by heuristically creating an answer span from reviews that best answers a question based on actual and trained which uses a gated mechanism and pointer to predict answer there are few studies using generative models to deal with there are mainly two types of methods for one is to use methods to first identify text passages that are most likely to contain answer and then perform qa on the extracted text passages which are essentially considered as a single the other one is to separately run qa over each obtaining multiple answer and then determine the best answer through mutual verification among the examples in the first type of methods include bert and masque these models require supporting text passages to be explicitly follows an relevant passages are extracted from context using a variant of which learns to rank passages and extract the most possible evidence span from the selective the selective passage is used for the gru decoder synthesizing in bert two independent berts were used to perform one bert takes the question and a text passage as input and then uses the hidden states of the cls token to train a classifier to determine if the text passage is relevant to the given the other bert is used for extracting candidate answers from relevant text the masque model is a generative reading comprehension approach based on abstractive masque uses a comprising of a question answerability a passage and an answer at each step of answer the decoder chooses a word from the mixture of three distributions derived from a from the question and associated multiple a representative example of the second type of methods is the main assumption of is that correct answers often appear in multiple documents with high frequency and and wrong answers are usually different from each builds a mutual verification mechanism between all answer which are separately extracted from different to select the best final most existing approaches require explicit annotations of supporting text passages in order to train qa models in a supervised in our setup supporting review passages to a question was unsupervised ranked by which may introduce noises to qa model training and poses a more significant memory network has been first proposed to model the relation between a story and a query for qa systems apart from its application in memory networks have also achieved great successes in other nlp such as machine translation sentiment analysis visual question answering social networks and summarization the main idea of memory networks is to use the attention mechanism to assign different weights to text passages so as to identify the most relevant passages for answer generation kumar et proposed a gated memory network to represent facts in different iterations during the learning process to verify the potentially related passages to generate an gui et used a convolutional architecture to capture attention signals in memory xu et leveraged the memory network as an information retrieval system to search possible entities in knowledge bases for complex chen et used the memory network to verify items in knowledge bases as passages and then generate generally existing qa methods mainly focus on using memory networks to weigh and derive representations of text passages and knowledge entities for answer we instead explore a novel structure of a hierarchical memory network composing of both context and answer memories for better capturing review context

exposure bias problem to the phenomenon of nmt tends to generate hallucinations under domain finds that the nmt tends to generate more tokens and less tokens than compared with this work mainly focuses on investigating the functions of the different modules and parameters in the nmt model during continual in this the work is most related to which tries to understand the effectiveness of continued training for improving the compared with their our work also explores the cause of the catastrophic forgetting problem in our work also analyzes the performance of nmt at the neuron every individual words attention hidden much of these works try to predict linguistic properties from the features generated by the neural such as sentence and on the these work try to understand neural networks at the representation or the neuron these work may show us how correlated are neural network modules with linguistic properties but cannot in we try to understand the nmt system at a more fundamental level by analyzing the behavior of model by doing we can better investigate how the change of the model affects the system out to the best of this idea is the first time to be applied to the nmt continual training continual which is also referred to as is widely used in nmt for the domain adaptation the biggest challenge for this kind of work is the catastrophic forgetting fine tunes the model with the fine tunes the model with the mix of the data and and add regularization terms to let the model parameters stay close to their original minimizes the between the output distribution of the model and the adds a discriminator to help preserve the features and fine tunes the whole model on the mixed training proposes to obtain the word representations by mixing their embedding in individual domains based on the domain presents a theoretical analysis of catastrophic forgetting in the neural tangent kernel compared with our work pays attention to exploring the inner change of the model during continual training as well as the cause of the catastrophic forgetting the ability to continually learn over time by accommodating new knowledge while retaining previously learned experiences is referred to as continual learning or it has been seen as a challenge and an important step towards true artificial catastrophic forgetting is the main problem in this front of this studied the relationship between the catastrophic forgetting and properties of task our work focus on investigating the inner reason for catastrophic it showed that task complexity should be considered when designing new continual learning more work needs to be done to understand catastrophic forgetting domain adaptation catastrophic forgetting is also a common challenge for domain adaptation most of these work assume that the data is still accessible during the domain adaptation which is not the case of this tries to solve this problem by learning based on the knowledge distillation adapts elastic weight consolidation method to avoid performance degradation in the this work shares the same motivation with ours but we have shown more direct evidence and thorough analysis to support our they find that it is useful to put more constraints on the important parameters for the which is similar to our final and we will show more evidence and analysis to support

signals from language modeling can be beneficial for downstream reducing the amount of training data among the most of these models are and retrieval is the task of ranking a collection of documents by relevance to a particular researchers have found that pretrained contextualized language models can effectively transfer signals to this either by using the model directly or by using the outputs as features into a larger there has been a multitude of work in this such as strategies for long passage aggregation and we refer the readers to for a comprehensive survey on these these models significantly outperform prior attempts to use neural networks for ranking and represent the most substantial gains in effectiveness for this task in the past our goal in this work is to help shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of this burgeoning body of analyses of recent models tend to take an empirical because analytic methods are impractical given the large number of diagnostic proposed by reformulate traditional ranking that documents with a higher term frequency should receive a higher ranking empirical studied neural ranking architectures that predate the rise of

attempted to characterize the strengths of ranking for found a bert model to be more effective at ranking documents for question queries interesting finding given that most prior ranking techniques tend to perform better with the effectiveness may be due to additional information provided by the question queries in the rather than the linguistic characteristics of the queries others have found that contextualized language models are more effective at identifying salient for identifies salient parts of a document to generate plausible deepct models term salience by trying to predict which document terms will appear in a epic performs by jointly modeling query and document term while also performing document these techniques use specialized and do not necessarily imply that vanilla

similarity can be a useful signal for these architectures only show that contextualized embedding similarity signals can be used for not what characteristics these embeddings rather than proposing new ranking in this work we analyze the effectiveness of existing models using controlled diagnostic which allow us to gain insights into the particular behaviors and preferences of the ranking outside of

ranking architecture yield different higher sensitivity shuffling document different language models sensitive different importance analyzing behavior neural ir sean work done internship sergey feldman nazli doug arman ir georegetown dc allen institute wa,we propose a commonsense reasoning framework that uses a commonsense knowledge base on the basis of the amr logic our framework consists of the amr graph integrating and pruning language model and graph path learning available at as illustrated in figure we first generate the amr graph from every question in the dataset and integrate all the nodes of amr with conceptnet as this full graph also includes some irrelevant relations to the interpreting questions can be guided in the wrong for this we suggest a new the acp pruned according to the relation the graph path learning module takes the pruned graph as an input and computes the attention score of each path by using the graph transformer which results in the whole graph the graph vector is finally fed into the transformer to model the interactions between the amr and conceptnet graph and transforms to the final graph the question and candidate answer from the dataset are passed through the language model producing the language the concatenation of the language and graph vectors turns out to the final representation that is used to predict the correct equal in contrast to other models mentioned in talmor which cannot provide interpretable reasons for predicting the correct answer from the our proposed method produces the reasoning paths that make the model transparent and that the reasoning paths that have high attention weights from the graph encoder possess potentially accurate information for these reasoning paths are depicted in figure as each word plays a certain role as a predicate or an argument in a the concepts of the amr graph also carry semantic meanings in the graph the amr graph is capable of interpreting the questions as semantically owing to these advantages of the graph structure and preserved semantic we use the amr graph for extracting commonsense knowledge to generate an amr graph from the raw we use the model of zhang which is an model that treats amr parsing as though most of the amr graphs generated from the model they might have some inevitable errors in the type of relations or of core roles in amr we split the given training set into the new training and test sets randomly to conduct diverse experiments with the new and test sets included and we suggest effective amr expansion and pruning rules for commonsense we expand the amr graph on all nodes with the conceptnet as illustrated in figure and prune the nodes that have edges known as and with considering that and are the top two frequent relations among any other relations as shown in table we prune the full graph into a more compact graph that only contains and which is called acp this procedure prevents the graph from discovering a tremendous number of paths as described in appendix since the frame node is defined as a central point in the amr graph like in figure combining other conceptnet relations with the root node may distract the process of path the frame node specific meaning additionally annotated by the number like at the end of the word is different from the meaning in conceptnet node even though it has identical for the specific meaning of the frame node is defined in propbank frameset while conceptnet node includes more diverse meanings such as in an activity like or we remove the conceptnet relations and nodes connected to the frame the proposed method is depicted in figure the graph g expresses fixed set of nodes and relation edges following this the acp graph is defined as the acp graph expressed in equation is the union set of the amr and the subgraph of conceptnet that contains amr concepts that are connected to and the amr graph is denoted as the subgraph of conceptnet matched with the concepts that are connected to and is defined as the proposed method performs commonsense reasoning over the acp graph and predicts the correct answer with the corresponding our model receives two types of which are text and and converts semantic representation to distributed to encode the text input into the distributed the language encoder which is the language model with a massive amount of corpus takes an input that is formalized as given the acp graph from the graph integrating and pruning the graph path learning module initializes the concept node vectors as the sum of the concept embedding using glove and absolute position inspired by the works of cai we modify the graph transformer to make the model reason over the relation paths of the acp to let the model recognize the explicit graph we first encode the relation between two concepts into a distributed representation using the relation the relation encoder identifies the shortest path between two concepts and represents the sequence as a relation vector by employing recurrent neural networks with a gated recurrent unit the equation for the represented relation is expressed as where indicates the shortest path of the relation between two the final relation encoding between concepts and is the concatenation of the final hidden states from the forward and backward gru which are presented in the equation to inject this relation information into the concept we follow the idea of relative position embedding which introduces the attention score method based on both the concept representations and their relation to compute the attention we split the relation vector passed from the linear layer into forward relation encoding and backward relation encoding as where is the parameter this split renders the model consider bidirectionality of the we compute the attention score considering the concepts and their note that and are the concept the equation is presented the first term in the last line of equation is the original term in the vanilla attention which includes the pure contents of the the second and third terms capture the relation bias with respect to the source and the final term represents the universal relation as a the computed attention score updates the concept embedding while maintaining communication interactions can be injected into the concept node the resulted concept representations are summed into the whole graph vector and fed into the transformer layers to model the interaction between amr and conceptnet concept the major advantage of this attention mechanism is that it provides a fully connected view of input graphs by making use of the relation attention since we integrate two different concept types from the amr graph and conceptnet into a single the model globally recognizes which path has high relevance to the question during the after obtaining the language and graph the model concatenates the two feed these into the softmax and selects the correct

generated question and the reference question written by kumar et adopted and meteor as followup works employed more such as the word movers distance and the paraphrasing to generate more kumar et designed a reward to measure the relevance between the input passage and the generated question based on their degree of the answerability reward measures whether the generated question can be answered by the input it is designed as either the confidence score that a qa model can correctly answer the generated or the overlapping degree between the target answer and the answer predicted by

extractive approaches in terms of various rouge scores identifying sentences which are relevant to the query is an important step for the for this various approaches were utilized such as counting word overlaps or the method though neural models based on supervised training have significantly outperformed various models for the answer selection task in recent years such neural models have not been effectively used for the task yet due to the absence of labeled data for the relevant sentences in the showed that neural models in a large question answering dataset could effectively select

for dutch coreference resolution is the dataset which consists of million words annotated for this corpus was a continuation of the corea project present a coreference resolution study conducted on this they use a which was originally developed with the corpus and then further improved in the corea and observe that the influence of domain and training size is thus underlining the importance of this large and the current best coreference resolution system for dutch is called and is based on the stanford system this system improved on the systems in the shared and a previous implementation of the stanford system for dutch the main focus of was evaluating coreference on literary for which a corpus and evaluation is most coreference resolution systems are evaluated using newswire but a domain such as literary text presents its own challenges for novels are longer than news and novels can therefore contain longer coreference the main benchmark for english is the conll shared task reports a timeline of results for this which shows the dramatic improvements brought by neural especially the systems on the neural coreference systems improved on previous work but were still relying on mention detection syntactic and heavy feature engineering they were outperformed by the first coreference resolution system by this system looks at all the spans in a up to a maximum and then uses a model that decides for each span which previous spans are good if the spans themselves are represented by word although the models by and are computationally efficient and scalable to long they are heavily relying on first order models where they are only scoring pairs of because they make independent decisions regarding coreference they might make predictions which are locally consistent but globally inconsistent introduce an approximation of which uses the architecture from described above in an iterative and also propose a approach to lower the computational cost of this iterative further improvements over were obtained through the use of deep contextualized elmo word the current scores are even higher by using bert finetuning this paper focuses on the model by present

manual mention in future work want improve neural system using genre metadata finetuning system extended hybrid system adding supervised,our work builds on prior work in relation extraction and relation extraction is a natural language process task of mining factual knowledge from free when giving a sentence with annotated this task degenerates into a simple namely relation some such as leveraged cnn or rnn to solve the relation classification these methods ignore the extraction of entities from sentences and could not truly extract relational when giving a sentence without any annotated researchers proposed several methods to extract entities and relations existing studies on multiple relation extraction task can be divided into four pipeline based such as firstly recognize entities and then conduct relation table filling based like represent entities and relations with shared but extract the entities and relations tagging based such as treat this task as a sequence labeling problem and need to design complex tagging based like apply model to generate relational triples our work is in line with based in contrast with the previous we reckon the triples in a sentence are in the form of a set instead of a and treat the joint entity and relation extraction as a set prediction models generate all the tokens of a target in parallel and can speed up models are widely explored in natural language and speech processing tasks such as neural machine translation and automatic speech recognition to the best of our this is the first work to apply models to information in this we resort to the model to generate the set of triples in one there is no canonical deep learning model to directly predict for set dense fully connected networks are sufficient but a general approach is to use autoregressive sequence models such as recurrent neural networks in all the loss function should be invariant by a permutation of the the usual solution is to design a

subjective social media sites define hate speech in legal terms as a or against various characteristics of including and many previous analyses have approached the study of hate speech analysis through the lenses of these examples include automatic hate speech detection modeled as a binary classification an learning model to identify toxic a quantification of conflicting opinion among and a classifier with embeddings learned from multiple deep learning a binary classification based although ignores the many subtleties of hate such as indirect direct hate speech and different forms of hate such as or the high prevalence of offensive language on social media presents an additional challenge for automatic hate speech detection several classification models have been introduced recently to better distinguish hate speech from offensive content on social media and to improve the automatic identification of various types of hate in a similar hierarchical annotation systems have been proposed that further distinguish the type and target of offensive providing additional granularity for automatic detection one of the major issues with automatic hate speech detection research is the limited amount of manually labeled weak supervised training allows for the use of large unannotated datasets by programmatically generating labels using heuristic weak supervised learning has been applied for problems like cyberbullying detection to give better performance than traditional so while datasets annotated using and hierarchical labels provide a greater depth of information for model the tradeoff is that further partitioning of social media posts leads to fewer training observations within each class recent reviews of work on automatic hate speech detection have been more conservative in their outlook despite despite the strong performance of recent automatic hate speech detection with high reported recall and scores efforts to replicate reported findings and to generalize models to other similar datasets have often while some of these failings are due to methodological shortcomings such as they are also related to the inherent subjectivity of hate the noisiness of social media and the biases present in with binary it is also difficult to report the extent to which hate speech detection models are conflating hate speech with general offensive speech in addition to these hate speech constitutes a small portion of the overall content on social leading to the presence of severe class imbalance in hate speech example include the datasets we use in this work as given in despite recent efforts to identify and address these there remains room for improvement in developing robust and generalized frameworks for automatic detection of hate speech on social in this we develop a number of classifiers comparing four sets of pretrained word embeddings and three different deep model we leverage an ensemble approach to address issues of class imbalance

train dependency relation categories well dependency we also plan improve system making efficient order train dependency parsing module extra available unannotated,this seems pretty there is a lot of work on error typologies for evaluation for that was not published in the past two paragraph could be neural sequence models are highly and do not have any inherent inductive bias to prevent them from generating outputs that are not entailed by the this flexibility can be an it allows them to handle text generation tasks like language story or dialogue response where this strict entailment is not a for tasks like machine and text where the semantic content of the output must be entirely reflective of the this is a major problem a user of the systems will not be able to trust that any generated text is an accurate reflection of the text they meant to translate or in these problems are further exacerbated by the fact that most existing models are trained using training algorithms such as maximum likelihood and is especially prominent when models are trained on a domain outside of that they are tested but also probably true for any neural i do not think there is any system where you can guarantee that it will not hallucinate content due to the discrepancies between training and inference time under domain shift or vulnerabilities to artifacts or noises in the training you sure it is actually due to for even if there is no domain shift and little or no noise during training i am pretty sure that nmt or summarization systems would hallucinate especially if the training data is i would argue it is rather due to on the decoder and its desire to generate fluent sentences at the cost of not being faithful to the commonly adopted metrics for sequence generations evaluations such as bleu scores rouge and recently proposed quality estimation metrics including bleurt and bertscores have been shown that they correlate poorly with they also require reference limiting their applicability to detecting halluciations in a deployed system at in these metrics compute the similarity between the candidate outputs and the annotated references which requires the availability of assessing the faithfulness of generations is concerned with the safety of which should be triggered before the machine outputs are exposed to several efforts have been made on automatic evaluation of faithfulness and truthfulness in abstract text by leveraging existing semantic inference question answering first employ a question generation system to generate natural questions based on the machine generated then questions are answered with a qa system using the source article and the summary the final faithfulness score of the summary is given by comparing the corresponding for the textual a natural language inference system is trained to predict whether the source article entails the summary or then the entailment scores are used as the proxy to assess the faithfulness of the these methods tailored for abstract text summarization are shown to have a weak correlation with human evaluation of in the absolute value of these metrics can not accurately assess how much hallucinations are within the for in the methods it is difficult to generate the same number of questions for all the thus fair comparisons between different outputs can not be looked around a bit and there is work on quality estimation that annotates span level along with severity on three for the multidimensional quality metrics standard which was also used in task of the shared task on quality estimation the severity of errors are classified for example error can be minor major or critical and also labeled with a type label specifying the error such as wrong word missing they may provide additional but systems do not need to predict i have not looked closely at the but this almost seems a strict superset of what is annotated similar to the spirit of our proposed quality in the machine translation community predicts if tokens are correctly translated based on human they do not distinguish errors in terms of fluency and a substitution error referring to a simple morphological variation is considered the same as a content word substitution changing the meaning of the in contrast to estimating the amount of human work required to fix we specifically identify hallucinations corresponding to only hallucination if the annotation standard of quality estimation is slightly the task of sequence labeling with both a sequence and the original input is the why could we not just use a standard

create pretrained evaluation model datasets models also would extend method generation we also interested investigating leverage detection methods mitigate hallucination problems conditional sequence,the techniques for textual network representation can be categorized into two the first uses fixed embeddings for representing textual these include models like tadw which uses matrix factorization to learn text and models like cene and dmte which uses a model to learn text the second kind of models use recent models are on this line of cane uses a mutual attention mechanism to learn matrix between text features across a node that is then used for finding embeddings by weighted average of the text wane uses a mutual attention mechanism for aligning word embeddings of the textual content in one node to the then pooling is applied to find the final gane uses optimal transport framework for attention instead of dot product for finding the affinity matrix between words in a neifa uses gating mechanism for getting embedding and also it uses gating for extracting information from structure embedding that is complementary to textual vhe uses a variational framework for learning embedding using a mutual attention apart from previously discussed methods on textual graphgan used for representation learning in homogeneous networks uses a similar adversarial framework as ours by using generator and discriminator both generator and discriminator separately learn embeddings for a but this model uses only the structural the performance of this model will be poor in the case of representation learning of sparse textual unlike previous the model we propose uses an adversarial framework between text embedding based discriminator and structure embedding based generator to learn efficient this will help in combining information from both text and graph modalities another advantage of our model is that it can extend to unseen nodes using the based supervision from the definition of the adversarial our new architecture for learning text embedding can combine both mutual attention and topological attention which resulted in more flexible text adversarial networks there is a huge interest in using gan for network representation learning because of its success in domains like image generation dialogue generation these are unsupervisedly trained models used for generating synthetic samples from the distribution same as that of the training for they use a generator network for generating the data and discriminator network for predicting whether samples are from the true distribution or the the learning is done by exploiting a minimax optimization between discriminator and graphgan is one such work where gan technique is used for representation learning in homogeneous it learns a generator that samples possible neighbours of a node and a discriminator for predicting links between a node and its sampled both generator and discriminator separately learn embeddings for a and the training of each model is done by alternating applying gradient steps on this model uses only the structural information and ignore all the textual data in the the performance of this model will be poor in the case of representation learning of sparse textual

outperforming initial attempts to apply deep learning and neural networks to the independent of the specific approach three general methodologies have been followed to learn discourse trees from small such as or discourse splitting the document into starting from the representation of the complete discourse down to individual assigning the two resulting a nuclearity attribute and predicting the relation holding between the starting from the list of edus and aggregating two adjacent units in every this approach is mostly realized using the cky dynamic programming strategy to obtain optimal trees as in and or using a greedy method a frequently used and more locally inspired approach of discourse parsing using the linear adopted from previous work in syntactic while the current traditional discourse parser by uses the method predicted by two separate support vector machines for prediction and relation neural models utilize perceptrons for classifying possible in our work we also follow the with the detailed description of our system provided in the following besides the active research area on discourse a second line of work has emerged trying to generate discourse treebanks through automated annotations from downstream such as sentiment analysis text classification summarization and fake news detection the majority of these approaches follows the intuition that discourse trees can be inferred from downstream tasks by predicting latent representations during the learning process of the task itself in an recent work by has shown that the trees resulting from this approach are not only poorly aligned with general discourse but furthermore are oftentimes too a rather different strategy has been employed by trying to explicitly generate a discourse augmented treebank through distant supervision from sentiment annotations in combination with learning and a cky tree generation while the resulting dataset has only been proposed and released the authors show promising results in their reaching the best performance when comparing their dataset against and the this leads us to believe that their treebank does not only learn but can also be used to infer general discourse structures on a large we will further evaluate this in section traditional discourse neural discourse datasets sentiment

works emphasize the use of emojis instead of for use a multimodal approach to recommend emojis based on the text and images in an instagram propose a algorithm to predict emojis based on the private instant conduct emoji prediction on social media text and they tackle this task as ranking among all the total number of unique emojis in their dataset is which is much smaller than the number of what is emojis are limited in while there exists an abundance of different incorporates the emoji information into the dialog generation and they use the emoji classification as an auxiliary task to facilitate the dialog generation to produce utterance with proper the most similar work to ours is where they generate recommended stickers by first predicting the next message the user is likely to send in the and then substituting it with an appropriate more often than not the implication of the stickers cannot be fully conveyed by text in this we focus on directly generating sticker recommendations from dialog user modeling is a hot research topic especially in recommendation which models the preference of user based on the user history interaction in the recommendation the user modeling systems use the purchase history or click records to model the user intrinsic interest and temporal most of the research typically utilize binary and assume a flat preference distribution over items for each they neglect the hierarchical discrimination between user intentions and user propose a novel memory network with triadic which takes both user intentions and preferences into account for the as for the user modeling in the news recommendation there are much side information can be used to obtain better user preference propose a neural news recommendation approach which can exploit heterogeneous user including the search queries and the browsed webpages of the to model the user preference of sticker we should not only model the sticker selection and the dialog context of each selected sticker should also be considered when modeling the user the memory network proposed by generally consists of two the first one is a memory matrix to save information and the second one is a neural network to the memory the memory network has shown better performance than traditional term memory network in several such as question machine text dialog system and the reason is that the memory network can store the information in a long time range and has more memory storage units than lstm which has the single hidden follow memory there are many variations of memory network have been memory network and dynamic memory our method is mainly based on the memory which employs the user history dialog contexts as the memory keys and the corresponding selected stickers the memory there are two main differences between our pesrs model and the previous memory the user history data is in chronological we should consider the time information when storing them into the to recommend more accurate the model should not only consider the user preference information stored in the but also incorporates the matching result between current dialog context and candidate the second difference lies in that we propose a dynamic fusion layer that considers both the memory read output and the matching result of the current compared with these we not only implement a memory but also provide a sticker selection framework that could incorporate the user sticker recommendation involves the representation of and interaction between images and which is related to the visual question answering vqa takes an image and a corresponding natural language question as input and outputs the it is a classification problem in which candidate answers are restricted to the most common answers appearing in the dataset and requires deep analysis and understanding of images and questions such as image recognition and object current models can be classified into three main early fusion later fusion and external one vqa model is which proposes an positional with that does not require a recurrent neural network for video question proposes an synergistic where candidate answers are coarsely scored according to their relevance to the image and question pair in the first answers with a high probability of being correct are by synergizing with images and the difference between sticker selection and vqa task is that the sticker selection task focus more on multimodal interaction between stickers and visual dialog extends the single turn dialog task in vqa to a where later questions may be related to former to solve this transfers knowledge from a discriminative network to a generative network with an rnn using a perceptual combines reinforcement learning and generative adversarial networks to generate more responses to where the gan helps overcome the relative paucity of training and the tendency of the typical approach to generate overly terse demonstrates a simple symmetric discriminative baseline that can be applied to both predicting an answer as well as predicting a question in the visual unlike visual dialog in a sticker recommendation the candidates are stickers rather than response selection takes a message and utterances in its previous turns as input and selects a response that is natural and relevant to the whole in our we also need to take previous dialog into previous works include which uses an rnn to represent context and and measure their more matches a response with each utterance in the context on multiple levels of and the vectors are then combined through an the final matching score is calculated by the hidden states of the extends this work by considering the matching with dependency more proposes a fusion network where the representations can be fused into matching at an early an intermediate or at the last traditional response selection deals with pure natural language while in our we also need to obtain a deep understanding of

simple effective could facilitate future research neural sequence,to tackle the challenge of having only very limited training data in languages for sequence labeling two major approaches are the first approach is to transfer knowledge from a source language with rich labeled data to a target language with little or even no labeled this is called sequence the other approach is to look for additional data sources and conduct weakly supervised in this we focus on two multilingual sequence labeling ner and entity the previous methods for named entity recognition can be divided into data

outperform approaches able better exploit wider achieved using smaller amount monolingual,recent advancements of natural language processing tasks were a direct result of using deep learning in these text is treated as sequences or spatial which allowed the modeling of higher level nlp concepts beyond the boundaries of the meaning of words in natural cnns and lstms were the proper representatives under this with respect to sentiment linguistic knowledge such as sentiment lexicons and pos tags has been utilized as auxiliary input for the deep learning to capture deeper levels of language specific features for greater formulating language specific linguistic knowledge needs considerable human another approach is to experiment different combinations and variation of deep learning as an end to end considering both the sequential nature and local information of cnns and rnns were basically experimented as deep learning strategies and many variants and combinations of these neural networks have been used for sentiment more these superior performances were achieved without using any language dependent cnns were initially applied towards the image processing tasks and later in the nlp mainly for text classification cnns achieved comprehensive results compared to the existing proposed an approach for sentence classi     tion using a cnn with word the task specific architecture which was obtained through fine resulted in further improvement in performances under this conducted an experimental analysis on the sensitivity of the hyperparameters for sentence classification using the comprehensive analysis on empirical findings and the discussion on guidelines for practitioners for cnn based text classification tasks were the foremost contents within the lstm is the most commonly used sequence model for sentiment experimented with an lstm for document level sentiment analysis where the suggested approach includes improvements for lstm architecture to capture overall semantic information in long the optimal performance on the text classification tasks including sentiment analysis were reported based on the different variations and combinations of cnn and sequence the combination of and cnn based model proposed by was used for sentiment classification where the target expression extraction process for sentence categories was carried out by the model and the cnn is capable of producing the sentiment detection introduced a model based on the combination of cnn and the focus of the proposed architecture is to use features extracted by cnn with the dependencies learnt through the rnn for sentiment analysis more recent research exploits the attention mechanism in sentiment argued that different parts of a document have no similar or relevant thus special attention should be given to some parts of a document to identify the overall sentiment they proposed hierarchical attention hybrid neural networks which combines convolutional gated recurrent units lstm units and attention mechanism to implement a better document classification it accordingly pays more or less attention to individual words and sentences when it constructs document representation with the two levels of attention mechanisms as attention and attention mechanism elevates words that are important to the meaning of the sentence while the attention mechanism gives more attention to sentences that contributes more to represent the overall meaning of the hahnn improves the performance of document classification and sentiment analysis tasks by incorporating the document structure in the model and applying cnns for the extraction of more the capsule which was initially introduced by as an improvement to the cnn was implemented to be used in nlp tasks including sentiment implemented different variations of capsule architectures as and for binary and sentiment analysis with a dynamic routing the key feature of the capsule architecture is the ability to capture context level information with the exact order or pose of the information with the vector representation of the the dynamic routing process of the proposed architecture could eliminate the disadvantages of cnns such as high computational cost and loss of information due to the max pooling strategy widely used in the transformer networks built solely upon the attention mechanism while neglecting recurrence and convolutions tend to produce promising results in the domain of in bidirectional encoder representations base and bert large models have produced performance for sentiment the high computational cost to build models for low resource languages hinder the use of bert towards the nlp tasks more another drawback of using bert for under resource is not having enough text to comprehensively learn contextual information as opposed to which has billions of related approaches for sentiment analysis in indic languages were comprehensively investigated according to the indic languages such as urdu and kannada are the languages with major research work for sentiment lexicons rule based and machine learning based statistical algorithms were initially experimented for sentiment analysis and deep learning based techniques were recently employed in this field to obtain better conducted the first experiment on deep learning based sentiment analysis for hindi there

sentiment sinhala is a morphologically but less resourced indic language when compared to languages such as english or even other major indic in the perspective of sentiment as well as in nlp in not many sentiment annotated corpora or sentiment lexicons are publicly available for conducted the      t experiment on sentiment analysis for a simple feed forward neural network was used with document term experimented with three new techniques to enhance the sentiment classi     tion the      t methodology extracts cross linguistic features related to sentiment of sinhala language based on a bilingual dictionary of english and a further analysis introduced the linguistic features speci     for sinhala sentiment this research then mainly focused on statistical machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines and where the generated lexicons in previous steps were used for sentiment also presented a technique based on sentiment the proposed method could be introduced as a method based on sentiment lexicon generation for sentiment the strategy has two major lexicon generation and sentiment analysis based on the generated sentiment for the purpose of sentiment svm and decision trees were experiment results suggest that the bayes approach surpasses the rest of the work of can be considered as the      t to experiment with deep learning techniques for binary sentiment analysis task in sinhala these techniques include lstm and models for a rather small data set with positive and negative sentiment these models were trained using sinhala word embedding thus no features were the same features were used to train statistical machine learning which included logistic decision random forests and although these classi     s showed a much superior performance with word embedding features as opposed to sparse features such as their results were inferior to that of this research carried out a comprehensive study on using different with respect to the dimensionality of the and the effect of punctuation proposed a strategy for sentiment detection of sinhala news comments for the same data set used by based on this is a rather advanced technique where the sentiment classification process was further improved considering the features with and fasttext the word level state and sentence level state with recurrent information exchange between each state of the network have proven to be able to capture long term dependencies and outperform the traditional lstm architecture used

quality estimation for is an approach of augmenting the available parallel data with the of monolingual sentences in the target language to increase the amount of data for training improved translation in proposed using this approach to solve the problem that the architecture struggles with   lack of adequate training the approach has since been used for training translation models for many language pairs the success of the approach has been shown to rely on three the quality of the synthetic data which depends on the quality of the backward model and the synthetic data generation method used the ratio of the synthetic to authentic parallel data used and the architecture of the nmt used many studies have shown that the quality of the backward system influences the performance of the ultimate nmt model more than other factors in low resource the available parallel data may not be able to train a standard backward model and the quality of the additional data generated using this model may hurt the quality of the final various research works have proposed methods aimed at training a standard backward model no matter the amount of authentic data available improving the quality of the synthetic and investigated the backward model on a language pair and the model on the low resource language pair through transfer learning posits that selecting the appropriate synthetic data generation method can offset the deficiencies of the backward investigated the application of the approach to improve the backward model in low resource relies on the parallel data between the two languages and the target monolingual data to improve the forward model the iterative on the other relies on the monolingual source and target data to improve the backward and forward models the backward model generates synthetic data to improve the forward model and the forward model does the same for the backward the process is repeated until a set amount of iterations or desired quality is the iterative was proposed in the work of to enable the backward and forward models to be improved over several the work hypothesized that if the approach has shown to be successful at improving the standard of machine translation repeating the procedure will further enhance the quality of the translations whereas the synthetic data generated by the backward model is mainly used to enhance the forward model in standard iterative enables the backward to be improved on the synthetic data generated by the forward the approach has been shown to successfully improve both the backward and forward models standard is used throughout the process but it relies also on the monolingual source deviating from the requirements of traditional where the monolingual source data is not the procedure cannot be the implemented with standard was shown to reduce the performance of machine improving the performance only after applying a tagging approach is an approach where a model learns from its own in machine a model is trained on the available parallel data and is then used to translate a given set of monolingual source sentences to generate a training this data is then used to train a better model than the generating ueffing first used the approach to improve statistical machine translation the work uses an existing system to generate the translations of a new set of source the confidence score of each of the translated sentences is estimated and based on these translations that are considered reliable are extracted and used as additional training data for improving the existing in neural machine explored the use of monolingual source data to improve the accuracy of a translation model through forward a baseline nmt model was trained and used to generate synthetic parallel data authentic source synthetic target since the nmt architecture consists of an architecture and the encoder is trained on the source data while the decoder learns representation based on the representations of the encoder and the target the use of synthetic data which often contains mistakes to train any or both of the encoder and decoder may deteriorate their to mitigate this the authors proposed freezing the parameters of the decoder when training on the synthetic target by the useful representations learned on the authentic data will not be unlearned when training on the additional in an approach similar to used on and statistical machine translation systems to better their their work investigated the use of iterative with quality estimation in a process that utilizes all of the monolingual data to improve the generating a baseline translation model is trained and is used to translate a given set of monolingual the quality of the synthetic sentences are determined using a quality estimation the best sentences are selected and added to the training this new training data is used to retrain the translation the rest of the sentences whose translations were not selected are translated again using the improved model and the procedure continues until all of the monolingual sentences are the work of investigated the feasibility of using the approach only without quality estimation freezing of any parameters to train a better nmt it was determined that not only is it simpler than the other it is also capable of improving baseline translation the authors used the approach to enhance the performance of a backward model in the the quality of the model was resulting in a better target nmt the only showed the applicability of the approach but did not investigate the extent through iterative training to which the backward model will continue to be improved if it is trained on the synthetic data it it also did not show the benefits or otherwise of data selection on the quality of the backward this proposes the iterative approach to improve the quality of the backward it also extends the work in to compare the use or otherwise of quality estimation in determining the best synthetic data for the backward quality estimation is a method used for translation quality the method was introduced to help in determining the quality of translations when reference text is not available when such texts are traditional metrics such as the evaluation understudy and the meteor are majorly the technique is particularly useful for indicating the reliability of translations especially to users who cannot read the source language for deciding the translations that are fit for publishing and those requiring human or automatic revision this technique has been shown to reduce the time taken for work on the technique was started in early with works such as and has been gaining prominence especially with the ever increasing reliance on machine translation recent works such as have achieved tremendous improvements in translation quality mostly using neural models to train better systems that are capable of estimating the quality of translations the qe technique was used in in works such as to determine the translations that are considered fit for retraining the generating model and has been shown to improve the performance of statistical machine translation instead of relying on the translated which can be good or the qe system enables the training of better translation models only on data that is estimated

future make data available,different from fully supervised learning which makes use of labeled the goal of learning is to use massive amount of unlabeled data to improve the models trained on labeled

forming a large pseudo labeled dataset to train a is a specific type of based method that is of growing involves training two a used to label unlabeled which is used as an augmented labeled then a is trained on the newly augmented this process can be iterated to further boost has been successfully applied in different fields such as computer vision automatic speech recognition in adopted the paradigm in image and achieves the result on imagenet proposed the strategy of noisy student a variant of built on top of efficientnet in trained an asr model on one million hours of unlabeled speech data using a proposed the concept of normalized filtering score that filters out pairs generated by the teacher to mitigate the noise introduced by the teacher and a combination of different methods fused the probability that a pretrained language model produces into the process of generating pseudo labels by a teacher acoustic then a student acoustic is trained on the combination of the golden labeled data and the pseudo labeled the approach yields notable improvements over strong asr the first is which assumes slight noise injected into the original input would not change its target label as well as the model under this data points can be crafted from the original data by adding small noise to the input without changing the output the second in the context of natural language processing the concept of learning has been adopted in different nlp tasks such as machine translation information extraction text classification and text generation studied the efficacy of on sequence generation tasks and found that can significantly boost particularly when labeled data is they also pointed out that the core of for sequence generation tasks is the noise injected into the neural which can be interpreted to smooth the latent sequence word vector models and language modeling pretraining can also be viewed as a specific type of learning by leveraging the information of data in the general other strategies for training models involve separation except cv and many nlp particularly neural machine translation has heavily adopted the idea of for studied the effectiveness of a technique used to synthesizing training data by leveraging two nmt models with opposite directions to translate monolingual target data into the source in a proposed the concept of dual which builds interactions between two agents learning their own dual learning later motivated the development of unsupervised machine where a common latent semantics space is learned through denoising and using only monolingual data data augmentation aims at increasing the amount of training data by adding slightly modified copies of existing data points or created new synthetic data based on existing data points the concept consistency training is widely used as a regulation to force the label of modified copies to the same as the original among different data augmentation data mixing is of growing interest proposed a method that crafted new data by linearly interpolating between pairs of random examples along with their by doing the model is able to smoothly model linear properties amid training on augmented in a substantial efforts have been paid to improve this in modified copies of existing data points are generated usually by synonym replacement and text editing noise injection

gcn may learn refined constituent representations may used inspired seminal works attempt move away sequence labelling model recent,logical reasoning systems such as pellet vampire spass have a rich set of features beyond what braid currently supports such as higher order logics more sophisticated identity and negation disjunction support and in some explicit defeasible rule they do not support rules with custom unification functions or dynamic features we believe are needed to overcome the brittleness of standard deductive our distributed reasoning framework which can scale to multiple on a cluster has several novel the design shares some similarities with the rete in that propositional atoms in rules are nodes in an inference graph we have nodes similar to beta nodes in the rete network to compute joint solutions across nodes are shared across rules and are associated with bindings that flow based on the rete network the rete algorithm is typically used for forward whereas our reasoning paradigm is backward we extend the approach to include a heuristic search strategy to deal with confidences associated with fuzzy unifications and support for existential and dynamic our overall design has several reusing solutions for previously solved goals minimizing communication overhead by ensuring locality of inferential computations on only passing new solutions between nodes to limit potential for efficient truth maintenance by storing a global proof support graph across all and updating results incrementally when the kb we contrast braid with markov logic networks a prominent srl an mln kb is a collection of fol rules with the kb itself acts as a template for generating a markov network which is created by grounding the variables using the constants in the in the final each node is a ground literal from a rule in the and each rule forms a that has a weight the basic idea is that given a particular configuration of truth values for the variables if a rule containing those nodes is satisfied and its weight is the probability of the world goes and vice versa rules thus act as soft constraints on the likelihood of the given a kb of true facts along with the weighted we can perform map inference to answer fol queries the main issue with mlns is scalability due to the grounding step which is exponential in the size of the mln     work with a static kb and do not support the dynamic addition of rules during the inference in recent there has been a growing interest in exploring approaches such as logic tensor networks which use distributed representations for logical for in each constant is mapped to a real valued each function is defined as a linear transform over its argument and predicates and clauses are associated with a score computed by using a tensor network the representations are learned by optimizing for approximate satisfiability of the clauses in the we share the same objective with such overcoming the brittleness of standard reasoning algorithms using statistical methods and fuzzy one concern with the ltn model is as each clause is trained using a separate tensor it is also unclear how much training data is needed to learn reliable it is not clear how such a model can produce precise for its final as the reasoning process becomes we take an alternate approach to combining instead of using distributed representations for fol and learning how to compose them using neural we use an styled model as the underlying reasoning paradigm which lets us preserve explicability of the final while allowing for statistical methods to be used for fuzzy and hypothesizing missing we believe our implementation based on a distributed and message passing is more a more directly related approach is that taken by in which the authors use a system to do from a query to find though the have distributed representations and the inference rules are learned during training by specializing generic templates like on the the notions of weak unification and dynamic rule induction in seem very similar to that in there are some important fundamental is at its core an differentiable system whose explanations are not fully transparent the embeddings for once learned during training are fixed at test time and independent of the local there are various hyperparameter choices such as number of rule template instances to create which can impact the final result and it is unclear how to set these on the other braid at its core is a symbolic reasoning engine that produces transparent logical explanations but uses distributed representations for doing fuzzy unification and rule the embeddings used in fuzzy unification come from a deep learning model which looks at the local context in which the appear the dynamically induced rules are fully interpretable and their confidence scores are estimated via language

property,traditionally solutions to code search were based on information retrieval techniques and natural language processing comprising of query expansion and reformulation expanded the query with synonyms from wordnet to search for code api documentation was leveraged for query expansion for code snippets retrieval by the codehow tool proposed by the fundamental drawback of the above techniques is that there is a disparity in word including their between the intent expressed in natural language and the implementation details in the source there is a need to semantically relate the words between the two traditionally code search is based on information retrieval expanded the query with synonyms from wordnet to search for code expanded the query with relevant api documentation and further applied the extended boolean model to retrieve the code lately deep learning techniques have been administered for understanding code semantics and structure approaches the task of code summarization through an recurrent the model generates a summary for the given code snippet which is then used to rank the relevance of the code to deep code search follows a slightly different dcs takes three aspects of code namely the method api invocation and the tokens and in parallel also takes the code descriptions as inputs to a different network and learns corresponding similarity between the embeddings are measured using cosine learning between embeddings is not explicitly in one of our experiments we apply a siamese network on top of dcs to combine the embedding learning framework with a siamese style of sharing parameters between the two sub neural code search is an unsupervised model that proposed a way to aggregate vector representation of the source code using weighting to form document it uses fasttext for learning the embeddings for these bags of the similarity between these embeddings are used for embedding unification is an extension over applying attention on the code both these works treat code and text as independent learning modules and project them in a common high dimension coacor proposed an reinforcement learning framework to generate code annotations and show the improvements on code retrieval when combined with existing cr models like dcs though the objective is we study siamese for joint learning on top of dcs without siamese networks are popular for tasks that involve finding similarity or a relationship between two comparable introduced first in images it has been applied in text domain to score relevance between a question and an answer candidate and for learning text similarity but to the best of our we are not aware of any work on applying siamese networks for semantic code our siamese based learning the task of code retrieval entails finding and indexing germane code fragments given a retrieving code with natural language query is a challenging due to the inherent difference in code and natural language

mani,learning under class the behavior of standard active learning methods which are driven by classifier uncertainty has a class balancing effect under moderately skew data under extreme class these methods may exhaust their labeling budgets before they ever encounter a single example of the rare this issue is caused by an epistemic the methods are driven by classifier but standard classifiers cannot be uncertain about classes that they have never guided learning methods address this by assuming that annotators can explicitly search for rare classes using a search engine search may be more expensive than but the tradeoff is worthwhile under sufficient class explicit search is not realistic in our search engines do not provide a mechanism for searching for a particular sense of a word and we care about recovering all classes that occur in our dataset with frequency above so searching by sampling uniformly at random would require labelling the probability of seeing at least one example to exceed we need at least see lemma for to find all such classes with high active learning with extreme class imbalance has also been studied under the paradigm that seeks to find as many examples of the rare class as possible in a finite budget of rather than minimizing classifier our approach instead separates explicit search from uncertainty minimization in two different phases of the learning for word sense many authors have showed that active learning is a useful tool for collecting annotated examples for the word sense disambiguation showed that entropy and methods offer significant improvements over random to our were the first to discuss the practical aspects of highly skewed sense distributions and their effect on the active learning they studied and techniques which are useful once one has but did not address the problem of finding initial points under extremely skewed and respectively share the two key observations of our good initializations lead to good active learning performance and language models are useful for providing a good our work modernizes these earlier papers by leveraging recent advances in the strong generalization provided by embeddings allow us to guide the initial search for rare classes with exemplar sentences which are not drawn from the training we also provide stopping rules that allow our approach to be run without the need to carefully select the target label which makes it practical run in an automated also leverage embeddings but they use label propagation to nearest neighbors in embedding this approach is similar to ours in that it also uses but we have access to ground truth through the labelling oracle which offers some protection against the possibility that senses are poorly clustered in embedding representations for downstream nlp there are a large number of recent papers showing that combining extremely large datasets with large transformer models and training them on simple sequence prediction objectives leads to contextual embeddings that are very useful for a variety of downstream in this paper we use contextual embeddings from bert but because the only property we leverage is the fact that the contextual embeddings provide a useful notion of distance between word the techniques described are compatible with any of the recent contextual models

relatively simple data seen making possible guidelines apply complicated language grounding tasks,observing that adversarial examples often transfer across different models the attackers run standard attacks on local surrogate models to find adversarial examples that are expected to transfer to the target such a straightforward strategy often suffers from overfitting to specific weaknesses of local models and attacks typically have much lower success rates than attacks directly launched on the target to answer this many methods have been proposed to improve the transfer success rate of adversarial examples on the target models by perturbing activations adding regularization terms to the example generation process or ensembling multiple local models adversarial examples are typically overfitted to the particular architecture and feature representation of a source resulting in transfer attacks to other target attempted to maximize the distances between natural images and adversarial examples in feature space to increase transferability an intermediate level attack that enhances adversarial transferability by increasing the perturbation on a specific layer of a tried to craft adversarial perturbations by perturbing activations that generalize not only across multiple cnn architectures but also across diverse computer vision proposed a feature distribution attack that leverages both and deep feature distributions of a substitute dnn to generate adversarial examples that are highly transferable to a target features to guide the search of adversarial which prioritizes the corruption of critical features that are likely to be adopted by diverse introducing a momentum term into the iterative process of adversarial example which can stabilize update directions and escape from poor local resulting in more transferable adversarial two regularization terms into the training loss function to guide the search of adversarial which alleviates the issue of vanishing gradient and reduces the variations of resultant adversarial they show that by introducing regularizers into the optimization process of adversarial the performance of attacks can be improved ensemble methods are most related to this hypothesized that if an adversarial example remains adversarial for multiple then it is more likely to transfer to other models as following this they improved transferability rates by using an ensemble of local methods have been used to generate transferable adversarial examples both in computer vision and nlp found that the local of loss surface harms the transferability of generated adversarial and proposed a attack to enhance the transferability by applying the locally averaged gradient to reduce the local oscillation of the loss unlike the methods that ensemble the predictions of different more transferable adversarial examples are generated by optimizing a perturbation over an ensemble of transformed images so that the generated examples are less sensitive to the local source models the methods mentioned above are designed to yield the best performance only on the model they are tuned to the generated adversarial examples do not transfer to other in proposed the ensembling attack that transfers better by avoiding dependence on any specific in the text searched for universal adversarial sequences of tokens that trigger a model to produce a specific prediction when concatenated to any input from a they focused on concatenated tokens generated using gradients under the and the founded universal triggers are usually human presented perturbations that cause models to change their predictions by the paraphrases generated via and generalized these perturbations into universal replacement rules that induce adversaries on many text they use the word to mean that their replacement rules can be used to any input text if some rules are matched with the but those rules were still generalized for some specific in we want to find the universal adversarial replacement rules by which the crafted adversarial examples can fool almost all existing the number of their replacement rules is quite and many texts do not meet the condition specified by their while our adversarial word replacement rules can be applied to most leading to higher success rates on various neural nlp in we search for an optimal ensemble with minimum number of models based on the understanding of the transferability among neural and the optimal ensemble can be used to generate adversarial examples that strongly transfer across neural nlp

scene from situated natural language and from inductive in this section we review some of the related we review some works around understanding a scene alongside a we review works in the joint fields of natural language and computer with the focus on their natural language understanding we discuss works that concern reasoning and inductive as neural network advancements achieved astonishing a new trend started to understand a scene via objects and their attributes in this trend aims to name and detect and describe the attributes and their relationship in a scene the work described in focus on the state and transformation of objects in a scene for understanding an sadeghi et in point to depicted interactions for understanding an some for example the work described in solely focus on detection of the attributes from including learning visual relations between objects in the alongside this researchers advised to shift the task of object recognition by names to recognition by descriptions which transforms the problems of finding attributes and symbol grounding to the problem of referential expression grounding some of the most promising works in this field are which try to find the referred given a phrase that describes object via attributes and interactions showed in the despite the fact that all of these works do their task based on attributes of they treat them as visual features for describing depicted which bound their domain of attributes to visually perceivable in this work we extend the domain of attributes by including attributes captured from linguistics have different points of view to some works extract the logical form of a through semantic parser the logical form that is computed from a language may be used for obtaining predicates from or obtaining attributes of a symbol in a defining the problem of understanding attributes as the problem of semantic their goal is to find the relation between attributes and the corresponding symbol from a in in the medium of the problem of finding attributes of an object in the text requires a symbolic detection even though may be deployed in detection of relationship and the role of some works use the combination of natural language and computer the work presented in captures semantic attributes from natural focused on category of objects inferred from a visual pronobis et in use attributes for resolving ambiguity in semantic which the two attributes from natural language are category and position of objects that are extracted by grammar in a framework for capturing spatial relationships between objects and inherited from the for learning a model is works that are dealing with maps are bounded to understanding verbal position and category of works that aim to capture more verbal attributes are using a shallow grammar inheriting from the dependency tree of the they cannot capture attributes from different linguistic where the dependency of words is not so in most realistic to overcome these we follow our previous work which can capture seven different attributes from different linguistic focus on attributes in knowledge representation is not on capturing attributes from different input nor grounding them to physical but rather on the relationship between and reasoning over rules are widely used as a way to express the relationship between inductive logic born at the intersection of machine learning and logic is widely used as a relational learning approach inductive logic programming learns rules from positive and negative supported by background the resulting rules should entail as many as positive regarding background and as few negative examples as possible in most realistic applications there is not a particular rule that includes all positive examples and avoids all negatives at the same to address this raedt et integrated probabilities with logic both in deductive and inductive while these works assume an initial knowledge in our work we use these methods in a case where background negative examples and positive examples are created incrementally from vision and some works combined knowledge engineering and natural combinatorial categorial grammar is one of the most famous language formalisms for semantic the work proposed in use cdg for obtaining logical form of a more precisely they compute lambda formula out of a sentence using for learning visual attributes by demonstration and spoken some researchers focus on models of language and logical for work described in shows an approach for transforming natural language into a logical using neural interacting with such system corresponds to giving the logical rules explicitly to the whereas in this we are proposing a system that can calculate the spatial logical relation implicitly

second is emotion given the audio and accompanying texts for two utterances and emotion confirmation is the task of identifying whether the two utterances express the same this task can be thought of as analogous to either hypothesis testing in speaker recognition or a classification it is motivated by the labeling mismatches among the various emotion corpora and is meant to better reflect the

speech and text trained separate speech and text emotion classifiers and then jointly optimized them for multimodal emotion an alternate method for creating multimodal classifiers is to use the embeddings from a hidden layer of the unimodal models for multimodal while created an ensemble of classifiers using the unimodal embeddings individually and their multimodal fed the concatenation to a

there are mainly two approaches to spoken term in the first pattern discovery is done directly with acoustic speech segments are matched using sequence matching algorithms like the matching could be based on conventional features or segment representations another approach involves a unsupervised subword modeling is first carried out with the untranscribed resulting in a symbolic representation known as the pseudo transcription of sequential pattern discovery is then performed by local alignment or string matching and clustering of sequential patterns the results of clustering could be corresponded to the discovered spoken terms in the given audio siamese neural network was proposed in it consists of two identical which share the learnable through the two siamese neural network is trained to perform a designated classification task on a pair of data the most common task is to determine whether the two input samples are from the same class or in other the exact class identities for individual training samples are not the training of siamese network requires relatively fewer training samples than conventional neural network classifiers siamese network is widely used in image it is shown to have the ability of comparing samples from unseen classes in the problem of one shot classification triplet network is an extension of siamese it consists of three identical which process input samples in including one reference one matched and one mismatched the network is trained to capture the similarity between the matched sample and the reference and the dissimilarity between the mismatched sample and the siamese network has been used in learning speech embeddings and it has shown to be able to learn effective subword units and term units representations it has been shown that siamese network is able to learn new representations from audio which facilitate spoken word classification it is also able to generate effective representations for spoken term detection while existing work assumes matched pair and mismatched pairs for training the siamese network are one challenge in unsupervised spoken term discovery is that no information is given to the system except the recording in order to apply siamese network in learning segment reliable matched and mismatched pairs are required for training the relatively less work is done on unsupervised generation of matched and mismatched training there is work that identifies training after frames from same segments are treated as matched frames from adjacent segments are treated as mismatched pairs there is also work that extracts training examples from available spoken term discovery with sampling based on distributions of speakers and pairs      supervised acoustic segmentation and

models to distinguish among unseen classes without annotated in computer zsl is a where a common approach is to relate unseen classes with seen classes through visual attributes or representations of the class names inspired by these calculate the similarity based on the word embeddings of intent the similarity scores are then used to transform the predictions from seen intents to unseen compatibility models attempt to learn a shared semantic space for label names and and then perform intent detection by measuring the similarity in this these zsid methods break the bottleneck of traditional intent detection while they are inadequate in associating the connection between seen and unseen there are also studies resorting to external label ontologies or attributes are laborious

lower case unless directly follow colon long dash,there are several fruitful directions for research focused on improving the computational efficiency and the interpretability of the attention sparseness plays a central role in all of as simple attention mechanisms inherently scale quadratically with sequence length and assign correlation between any two input one line of research is that of incorporating sparseness by restricting attention patterns to introduced two sparse matrix which reduce the computational complexity from to and successfully applied this method to language modelling leveraged algorithmic insights to create a sparse attention mechanism with computational they used local sensitivity hashing to cluster tokens that should attend to each other and only compute attention within tokens from the same more directly related to our work is that of who looked directly at sparsifying attention patterns rather than at the underlying matrix factorization and reduced the computational complexity of attention from to using gpu kernels one key difference between these approaches and ours is that we do not impose any a priori restrictions on the type of attention patterns we can and we show theoretical computational gains with specialized gpu implementations rather than reduce the computational complexity of our and explored directly incorporating sparseness into transformer models through the choice of activation functions and introduced the this encompasses both softmax for and sparsemax for for any is provided an efficient implementation and experimented with leverage global attention rather than creating a sparse attention pattern for each and we manage both to provide quantifiable speed guarantees and to achieve higher sparseness in extend the lottery ticket in the context of nlp and prune network there has been a lot of research on understanding overparameterization and developing methods that make bert models faster and more found that different attention heads encode similar patterns and hence these heads are not always all they obtain good performance by removing entire attention heads at test prune whole transformer layers at a time and again obtain good performance while removing a large percentage of the model our pruning method takes a more approach and prunes individual connections rather than whole heads or we speculate that our method could be used in conjuction with the and leave this for future

knowledge across domains to increase the amount of data that is available for training one of these approaches relied on adversarial training to learn a domain adaptive classifier in another domain or language where training data was plentiful while ensuring that the model generalizes to the domain these approaches have not used a generic language but perform for each task adapting models the effectiveness of transfer learning in settings was previously demonstrated for machine translation sequence tagging and sentiment classification all this prior work does not use general lms but transfers knowledge from a model to a close to target some previous work has analyzed the performance behavior of the bert model in different showed that a classifier that a bert model generally has wider optima on the training loss curves in comparison to models trained for the same task from indicating a more general classifier examine the adaption phase of lm based classifiers by comparing and feature extraction where the lms parameters are in we focus on the setting where less than data points are available for layer freezing in deep transformers experiments by indicated that the first layers of a lm capture a more general language while later layers capture more with this introduced gradual unfreezing of the transformer layers during each beginning with the last analyzed the loss surfaces in dependency of the model parameters before and after training and came to the same conclusion that lower layers contain more transferable none of the work has considered the training set size as a dependent parameter as our experiments presented in this active learning in nlp there is some prior work regarding active learning for nlp tasks using deep neural explored active learning for text classification using a model similar to our they used embeddings and focus on representation querying pool points that are expected to maximize the gradient changes in the embedding used active learning for named entity recognition they proposed a acquisition strategy named maximum normalized which is a normalized form of the constrained confidence estimation using this they achieved performance in comparison to a model using the bald acquisition function and mc dropout without needing multiple forward this approach is not suitable for any arbitrary model architecture but requires

related to several important research directions of nmt formulation should be moved out from related works the knowledge distillation part could be moved in improving nmt with monolingual nmt heavily relies on a large amount of bilingual data with parallel sentence which is expensive to to overcome this many works have been proposed to leverage the rich monolingual data to help the training in the which can be unified into two one idea is to incorporate external language models into the nmt which improves the fluency in target use the back translation approach to exploit target side monolingual they back translate the target side monolingual data to source side through an additional nmt model learned on the bilingual then the generated data will be paired with monolingual data as the original bilingual data will be augmented with the synthetic parallel corpus for further training the nmt learns from data in a game via dual where the source sentence is first forward translated to the target space and then back translated to the source the reconstruction loss is used to benefit the propose to jointly train the and nmt where two models can provide pseudo data for each while target side monolingual data has been extensively there exist few attempts to use the source side and explored in statistical and neural machine translation albeit with limited shows that the perturbation on the input and hidden states is critical for on this study is conducted on relatively monolingual and therefore st remains unclear in the ensemble and kd for among various model aggregating methods in machine the most effective and widely adopted methods for nmt is the let and denote the source and target language spaces and denotes the given translation let denote the vocabulary of the target in this given the source a group of individually learned models cooperate together to generate the target sentence step by more the ensemble method generates the target sequence by averaging the predicted probabilities of each a commonly used kd approach is ensemble where each individual nmt model distill the knowledge from an ensemble more learning is proposed to distill the knowledge from a dynamic ensemble teacher model during by there is no teacher model and no ensemble procedure in and we just improve individual models together through reciprocal note for models such as conventional statistical mt or nmt with decoding direction cannot be aggregated with common models with ensemble which means is much more

methods in hypernym extraction generally fall into one of the following four classification distributional method and deep learning the method directly uses the syntactic patterns in such as defined and this method is commonly applied in early works due to its simplicity and the majority of these approaches apply the symbolic method that depends on patterns or features which are manually crafted or because only a small fraction of syntactic patterns can be these methods usually have a low recall in order to cover more considers pos tags instead of simple word which raises the recall to improve the generalization of the starts to model the pattern matching as a probabilistic process that generates token proposes the use of directed acyclic called lattices to classify definitions on to better cluster definition the words are replaced by their for a simple definitions that is a and is a are in the same class that is characterized by a pattern is a in this more patterns can be characterized to identify the in recent much research pay attention to extracting hypernyms from larger data resources via the high precise of extract hypernymy relations from the commoncrawl web corpus using in order to address the low recall of method in large data integrate distributional methods and patterns to detect hypernym relations from several existing the pure approaches are generally given the fact that syntactic patterns are either noisy by nature or it is very difficult to further improve the performance in this to overcome the issue of generalization in the the classification method is proposes a method to learn the generalized pattern and assign scores to candidate the scores are used to identify the true hypernym out of uses conditional random fields to identify scientific terms and their accompanying uses the role of syntactic dependencies as the input feature for a support vector machine based explores the features in the dependency tree these classification approaches heavily rely on manually specified patterns learned from sentences or features analyzed from the nlp tools may not fully represent the syntactic in the nlp tools like dependency tree analysis are often and error at early steps may propagate which eventually leads to inaccurate final the distributional method is based on the distributional inclusion hypothesis which suggests that a hypernym tends to have a broader context than its hyponyms if the similarity between two words can be accurately then a hypernym should be associated with a similar but larger set of words than its hyponyms tests the distributional inclusion hypothesis and find that hypothesis only holds when it is applied to relevant because word embedding can reflect the corresponding semantic constructs semantic hierarchies based on the notion of word uses linear classifiers to represent the target words by two vectors introduces a unsupervised method to discover hypernym via vector proposes a novel representation learning which generates a term pair feature vectors based on bidirectional residuals of reaches a state of the art performance in general the application of the distributional method relies on a very large corpus to learn the word the distributional inclusion hypothesis may not be always in the task discussed in this because many terminologies occur infrequently and the length of a definition is usually it can be very inefficient to learn word the recurrent neural networks have been applied to handle many sequential prediction by taking a sentence as a sequence of rnn also works in a variety of nlp such as spoken language understanding and machine it is applied in hypernym extraction as converts the task of definition extraction to sequence using a strategy the infrequently appeared words are replaced by their corresponding the sequence mixed with words and pos elements is fed to the long memory rnn to predict the more proposes a neural network model with yields an enhanced performance compared with the first phase is constructed by a lstm to learn the sequence then a crf and a logistic regression are used to refine the classification both of the two works focus on although considers the pos the purpose is only to reduce the total number of words by grouping less frequent words together according to their pos while they demonstrate improved performance compared with other they are only tested in wikipedia where the definition usually has a very regular the performance on other irregular definitions remains

where researchers have compared different approaches in data collection and their impact the model talk about different behaviour between and lab the degree of due to the high data demands of training dialogue running laboratory data collections at scale for this purpose has became one of the earliest large datasets for dialogue research was collected with the let us go system this dataset includes interactions of with a agent who provided bus schedule information in a similar paradigm was used in who collected however instead of real bus were paid to interact with systems over the many data collections involve acting either as the as in the paradigm or the the way they contribute might be different depending on the design of the data in are shown the history of the dialogue and they are asked to add a coherent they are typically given some which they should take into account when acting as the wizard or in workers may also have to perform annotation on the previous user according to a set of instructions although this method was mostly used for data it could also be used to collect a diverse corpus a variation on this data collection method is described in where the framework would generate a set candidates for the wizards to select in a similar fashion as to what was done in for the data used in this while could be a good solution for creating large amounts of this method has an impact on the quality of the due to the rapid nature of the to increase the quality of the dataset in instead of a limited set of subjects were subjects contributed to the data collection both as the user and the they swapped roles during the data which made them aware the agent was played by another this approach is not very scalable and to perform larger a hybrid model where are paired with trained subjects to act as the wizard has been used by hiring subjects to act as wizards is a strategy followed to improve not only the quality and consistency of the but also the quality of the necessary for downstream this paradigm was also used in who collected a in authors have also collected a similar amount of data using where a single authored both the agent and the user unlike what was found by for authors found that dialogues were richer in content and a different approach has been used in a dataset where a a probabilistic was designed to create dialogues with a variety of trajectories once this structured representation of dialogue semantics is the task is to paraphrase them into natural while datasets such as these are widely used for they have a few for research in spoken their usage is limited since the datasets are mostly not the exception is where could listen to the agent response using even in this the timing aspect of spoken interaction is there is some overlap in the domains covered by these datasets this raises questions about their possible usage for training models in totally new domains to mitigate the first there have been some collections in the such as the one presented by where an amazon alexa was part of an itinerant where visitors could interact with it using this dataset contains more than dialogues in which is an impressive number for an data but still below the dialogues collected in given that these datasets cover a variety of different studies have been conducted investigating how a model trained on a source domain performs when tested on a different target domain another line of research has tried to find the minimal number of dialogues from the target domain that should be used during training to achieve a competitive performance since there is a fair amount of overlap between comparisons between models trained with different datasets are starting to the schema guided dialogue dataset collected by was used to train a which was then tested in mutilwoz both datasets were but the methodology followed was slightly despite this the model trained with the sgd dataset outperformed the art at the in terms of joint goal accuracy in multiwoz advances in natural language processing have been made by training neural models with very large datasets and applying those models to a variety of downstream these dialogue models have been released for general use and are trained on a variety of including twitter and reddit while these models can address questions and perform they might fail to capture specific aspects of the task in attempted to address this with their which was trained with an ensemble of several dialogue datasets publicly this model was successfully tested in different downstream tasks including dialogue act entity extraction in dialogue and response the examples describe attempt to create powerful general purpose neural models which can be used for a variety of tasks in instead of reddit this model was trained using dialogues for a variety of domains such as restaurant ordering food or asking for a taxi to give a few while there has been shown that this strategy works quite well for a variety of downstream there might be cases where the domain is completely different to those used in dialogue research this which may result at this models falling there might be cases where rather than a a new model has to be created from a data collection has to be access to data from conversations in that domain could be a good starting however this is not always in both and models were trained and tested on data collected with different their focus was rather on the overall performance of the models rather than in optimising the data trained a models for the restaurant domain using both artificial data and real the performance in the real data dropped

results analysis demonstrate effectiveness generalizability easily adapted different number knowledge in would like infuse knowledge sources investigate various relations improve quality,deep learning models have been widely use in natural language including text classification the studies of deep text representations can be categorized into two one is focusing on the word another group mainly study the deep learning structures that can learn better text typical deep structures include recurrent neural networks based long memory convolutional neural networks and language models like bert reason why deep learning methods have become so popular is their ability to learn sophisticated semantic representations from which are much richer than label smoothing is first proposed in image classification tasks as a regularization technique to prevent the model from predicting the training examples too and has been used in many including image classification language translation and speech recognition ls improves model accuracy by computing loss not with the but with a weighted mixture of these targets with a uniform noise the label distribution generated form ls cannot reflect the true label distribution for each training since it is obtained by simply adding some the true label distribution should reveal the semantic relation between the instance and each and similar labels should have similar degree in the in label smoothing encourages the model to learn rather than learn more accurately of the knowledge in training which may have the risk of label embedding is to learn the embeddings of the labels in classification tasks and has been proven to be convert labels into semantic vectors and thereby convert the classification problem into vector matching then attention mechanisms are used to jointly learn the embedding of words and labels use label embedding in a sequence generation model for classification which captures the between in our we also use jointly learn the label which can be used to further capture the semantic relation between text and label distribution learning is a novel machine learning paradigm for applications where the overall distribution of labels a label distribution covers a certain number of representing the degree to which each label describes the ldl is proposed for problems where the distribution of labels gives out several algorithms for this kind of the true label distribution is hard to obtain for many existing classification tasks such as and mnist where we only have a unique label for each in this kind of classification ldl is not

multilingual,several publications in controllable natural language generation have reported impressive particularly interesting is the work regarding the ctrl and meena neural these projects represent single neural networks that model both natural language as well as input commands our work differs from ctrl and meena in that we seek to achieve content control and separate the language model from the control model to avoid the language the recently published language model is capable of learning new linguistic modeling tasks without any as the authors state in their it is a predictive model and therefore not ideal for text several publications in controllable natural language generation have reported impressive particularly interesting is the approach taken by plug and play language models which bears significant resemblance to our own despite the two approaches having been developed completely independently our work differs from pplm in multiple foremost among them being our distinct uses of neural networks to produce perturbations in the pretrained rather than using summed discriminator gradients to produce perturbations as with pplm attribute we train a neural network to produce perturbations adversarially against a this makes our approach compatible with arbitrary discriminator including any which may not provide gradients to the perturbation model during training our novel approach also enables us to avoid adopting a greedy approach to textual control whereas the pplm paper is focused primarily on greedy the differences in our methodology carry over to our data where our novel data curation approach does not require text data exemplifying target behavior and which could be generalized to inputs in section we present experimental results comparing the npi and pplm approaches which demonstrate the relative strengths of both and discuss the merits of each the work regarding the ctrl meena and neural networks also demonstrates significant progress in controllable natural language these projects represent single neural networks that model both natural language as well as input commands our work differs from ctrl and meena in that we seek to achieve content control and separate the language model from the control model to avoid the language the recently published language model is capable of learning new linguistic modeling tasks without any as the authors state in their it is a predictive model and therefore not ideal for text while there has been work which suggests neural architectures can learn to networks are typically trained to model various tasks we argue that modeling natural language and responding to commands are two fundamentally different and that a neural network can therefore not optimally model both as suggested by the free lunch theorems by wolpert macready the theoretical ideas which form the foundation for our approach to controllable natural language generation are the free lunch theorems by wolpert macready which state that an algorithm gains in performance on one class of problems is necessarily offset by its performance on the remaining we therefore contend that a network that is optimized to model natural language cannot also be optimal for the significantly different task of producing controlled text in accordance with given and vice while there has been work which suggests neural architectures can learn to networks are typically trained to model various tasks our own approach leverages a network that models a sequence of controls in similar to the multiple modeling problem addressed in feng jin shiliang sun neural network multitask learning for traffic flow forecasting we hypothesize that the free lunch theorems still apply for tasks that differ in domain and scope as significantly as modeling natural language differs with command rather than model these tasks our proposed method of targeted text generation makes no permanent changes to a pretrained language model which is assumed to be an optimal model of natural language and instead leverages an additional neural network trained on a separate objective to manipulate the inner workings of the pretrained language model in response to we focus our experiments on controlling the output of the autoregressive language model though other autoregressive transformers such as xlnet and could theoretically be controlled in a similar and we propose further research be done into controlling these we use several variations on vanilla neural network architectures in various as well as an adversarial setup for training our npi the npi loss function was inspired by the loss function introduced by bethge much of our code was adapted from the hugging face transformers github repository and is available online our which seeks to alter the functionality of pretrained has significant crossover with adversarial attacks on neural networks as well as the field of ablation testing for neural networks our work differs from that of adversarial perturbations of models in that we formulate our loss function such that it encourages the perturbed outputs to be as close to the original outputs as possible while still introducing the desired whereas related work does not incorporate this condition

related to agreement and if this pattern is general if there are very few nodes tracking dependencies in general this may limit the capacity of the models to process long sentences with high for reasons similar to those that may limit human sentence processing to test whether nodes are sparse in we require a approach for mapping the context dependencies of every unit in the language context previous work by investigated the duration of prior context that lstm language models use to support word was measured by permuting the order of words preceding the preserved and observing the increase in model perplexity when the preserved context gets found that up to of prior context were relevant to the model but that the precise ordering of words only mattered within the most recent the method employed in this study was analogous to the approach used to measure in human brain responses to movies and to auditory narratives inspired by the findings of and in the present study we set out to map the across all of the individual units in the lstm this enabled us to relate the timescales to the effects of ablation and the network architecture in our context manipulations included

effectively help downstream existing methods are mainly categorized into keyphrase extraction and keyphrase traditional keyphrase production methods directly extract significant spans as keyphrases through candidates extracting and ranking these traditional methods can only extract keyphrases that appear in the text with a sequential to produce absent which do not appear as any continuous subsequence of based models become a popular techniques include copyrnn corrrnn with coverage mechaism and reviewer and reinforcement these works do not consider the information or the logical structure of the which provides important clues for generating document documents such as science literatures and news articles are well the hierarchical structure of the documents are used in various nlp tasks to boost the incorporate the knowledge of the hierarchical structure to text classification utilizes the structural information to detect significant plagiarism induce latent document structure for generating and in keyphrase extraction propose to add document structure to features to help identify and treat the document title as a dominant role to the overall document and let it guide the generation and in our we consider the logical structure of the whole documents and propose a sentence selection module to determine which part of the document is however it is difficult for the module to learn the binary indicator from and we adopt weakly supervised learning in our training supervised for lacking enough annotated weakly supervised learning has been an active research direction in various nlp and they mainly contain two candidates extracting and the first step produces several candidate phrases with heuristic methods such as tags or then the candidate phrase will be sorted according to the probability of becoming the keyphrase with supervised method or unsupervised method these traditional extraction methods cannot produce absent to solve the problem that the extraction model cannot produce absent first proposes a model named which is enhanced with an attention mechanism and copy since various of mechanisms and methods are applied to this framework to improve corrrnn introduces the coverage mechanism and proposes the review mechanism to ease coverage and duplication makes use of title information and regards the title as extra information to guide the source they think previous approaches treat the title and main body and they use beam search to generate multiple proposes two methods catseq and catseqd that can generate multiple keyphrases one

solve this task by posing it as a problem with the success of models on text based tasks researchers have explored and shown success in applying them for speech recognition our architecture is based on these other slu models also closely resemble this framework the task for slu is formulated as a target text sequence by wrapping the target english tokens with intent and slot which was shown to achieve state of the art results our approach improves upon these models by introducing transfer the transfer learning paradigm we adopt here is similar to prior efforts that use multiple tasks or pretraining to improve slu performance the shared training idea also has prior these efforts require parallel data or are evaluated on a simpler classification task zeroshot where we only have text nlu training data but no audio has also been approached this task using speech they generate synthetic speech from text using a text to speech system and use the resultant audio to train their while this approach is simple and its success greatly depends on access to a good tts we propose a method that can perform this without any tts and can also be used in conjunction with a tts system to further improve an important part of all these models is the representation of the raw audio waveform is typically converted into higher level features before being passed to the actual while cepstral coefficitents have been the traditional choice for this features have become more popular recently we use lfb features

data with or for leveraging multilingual added language code and target forcing in order to learn the shared representations of the source words and specify the target demonstrated a multilingual mt with three different strategies which modify their built multilingual mt systems by adding a layer to transform the source embeddings and representation into a universal space to augment the translation of low resource which is similar to implemented a massive multilingual employing many language all of the mentioned works have shown substantial improvements in they are less correlative to our translation although multilingual mt equips a shared space with many rare word translation is still the issue that needs to be the task of dealing with rare words has been mentioned in previous copied words from source sentences by words from target sentences after the translation using a bilingual and learned word similarity from monolingual data to improve their our approach is similar to these but we only learn similarity from the shared multilingual space of mt addressed the rare word problem by using the synonyms from and presented different solutions to solve rare word situation by transforming the embeddings during the training of their those solutions cannot be applied to the transformer in the embeddings of rare tokens and universal tokens are jointly learned through a plus parameter while we only add a scalar value to the monolingual data is used to generate synthetic bilingual data in sparsity data proposed method that uses a backward model to get the source data from the monolingual target in shown the technique by employing a forward model to translate monolingual source data into the target incorporated both mentioned techniques into their nmt monolingual data is also demonstrated its efficiency in unsupervised machine translation or in multilingual nmt in our we use the method to produce pseudo bilingual and it is then used to train our multilingual nmt

such as sentiment slot filling and so another line is to leverage hidden semantic information to construct supervised signals for intent feature in this we follow the second line to model there are many classical unsupervised clustering such as hierarchical methods and the pattern representations suffer from high computational complexity and poor though some feature dimensionality reduction and data transformation methods have been these methods still can not capture semantics of intent with the development of deep researchers adopt deep neural networks to extract friendly features for the joint unsupervised learning combines deep feature learning with hierarchical clustering but needs huge computational and memory cost on deep embedded clustering trains the autoencoder with the

bidirectional encoder representations from transformers bert is trained on a masked language modeling objective on a large text corpus such as wikipedia and as a sequence modeling it has achieved results in a wide range of natural language understanding including machine translation and text with an additional layer on top of a pretrained bert we can models for specific nlu in our we utilize this framework in all three components identified in section by starting with a pretrained huggingface we plan to leverage both extractive and abstractive candidate document summarization in our in terms of learning we view extractive summarization as a sentence classification previously proposed models include the sequence the neural and the sequence model with a global learning objective for ranking sentences optimized via more graph convolutional neural networks have also been adapted to allow the incorporation of global information in text summarization abstractive summarization is typically cast as a learning the encoder of the framework reads a document and yields a sequence of continuous and the decoder generates the target summary both approaches have their own merits in generating comprehensive and novel hence most systems leverage these two different models in one we use the extractive component to identify tokens in a candidate document that may be relevant from a pm perspective and use the abstractive component to identify potential terms that may not necessarily be in the document but nevertheless characterize it for pm most of the neural text summarization as described in the previous adopt the framework that is popular in machine as such the vocabulary on the decoding side does not have to be the same as that on the encoding we exploit this to design a summarization trick for pm where the decoder outputs both regular english tokens and also entity codes from a standardized biomedical terminology that captures semantic concepts discussed in the this can be trained easily by converting the textual queries in the training examples to their corresponding entity this trick is to enhance our ability to handle vocabulary mismatch in a different way we created biomedical entity tagged for this bmet embeddings are trained on biomedical literature abstracts that were annotated with entity codes in the medical subject headings codes are appended to the associated textual spans in the training so regular tokens and the entity codes are thus embedded in the same semantic space via pretraining with the fasttext besides regular english the vocabulary of bmet thus includes mesh codes and a subset of supplementary in the mesh codes are differentiated from the regular words by a unique for for mesh code with our summarization model can now translate a sequence of regular text tokens into a sequence of biomedical entity codes or vice that we use mesh as a new facet besides those already provided by the expected output for the mesh facet is the set of codes that capture entities in the disease and gene variation

fully proves intents recommend policy model trained via new reward helpful,our paper is located at the intersection of unsupervised inference and the area of discourse there is a large number of diverse such as variational autoencoders sparse autoencoders and autoencoders within the last general autoencoder frameworks have been frequently used to compress such as in more sequential autoencoders have been applied in the area of nlp with many popular such as learning models having strong ties to sequential based on the promising results of the sequential researchers started to compress and reconstruct more general structures in such as showing that with available the translation task can be learned with a style neural autoencoder variational autoencoders have been shown effective for the difficult task of grammar induction while both previously mentioned applications for autoencoder models require readily available tree structures to guide the aggregation another line of work by overcomes this requirement by using the reconstruction error of an autoencoder applied to every two adjacent text spans as an indicator for syntactic correctness within a in their combine the objective with the autoencoder training an unsupervised which is subsequently on a supervised while their model is clearly comparable to our there are three major they make local decisions on the aggregation of spans to generate a tree rather than optimizing the complete process their model uses an unsupervised objective in the initial step but requires supervision in later stages and the model has been only applied to syntactic in we apply our model to discourse which arguably introduces further as we will discuss in section showed a promising approach to infer tree structures in a holistic and parallelizable generating trees solely relying on in their they make use of the allowing the neural network to make discrete decisions while still being able to use standard approaches like to optimize the by combining a similar objective to and we utilize the discrete in positioning our work at the intersection of these two lines of the general task of tree inference has been mostly explored on for instance in and as described or by applying a reinforcement approach or cky methodology to syntactic our work employs a fully differentiable approach to a similar problem in the area of discourse in discourse parsing there have been multiple attempts to overcome the aforementioned limitations of human annotated all previous models use downstream tasks to infer discourse while this is a valid shown to achieve sota results on the discourse parsing task as well as performance gains on downstream tasks those discourse structures are likely and need to be either combined across multiple downstream tasks to avoid structures or can only be applied in similar while further work has been trying to infer discourse structures in a linguistically supervised manner with the method proposed by showing very promising reaching similar or even superior good performance when heavily exploiting syntactic markers in combination with general linguistic the approach appears to be very specific to the data at hand news articles from the wall street journal raising questions in regards to to such compared to supervised achieve this by heavily exploiting syntactic structures within and between which appear to be specific to the data at hand news articles from the wall street journal therefore arguably overfitting to such while this approach shows clear evidence for the benefits of syntactic structures in discourse the results are heavily skewed towards the available data at hand news articles from the wall street in this we explore a purely unsupervised instead of relying on domain specific syntactic we infer general discourse trees applicable to any by exploiting inherently available information from natural data making our model similar to approaches in language

because of the variety of punctuation and syntax and the presence of idiosyncratic text formatting this problem becomes especially exacerbated in the case of unstructured texts such as the ones

provide universal analogy insurance faq dataset nlg dataset extensive universal representation model holds promise demonstrating accurate vector arithmetic regard phrases sentences retrieval use acknowledgment the computer society usually uses plural form,section will be written when it comes to major languages like numerous works have been proposed for accurate identification of hate speech that is based on ml and classic methods that rely on manual feature support vector logistic decision random and gradient boosted approaches based on deep neural that learn multilayers of abstract features from raw which are primarily based on or long these approaches are mostly deep referring to the depth of the neural networks despite the growth of studies and existing ml languages such as bengali lacks resources such as rich word embedding models and comparative evaluation on nlp these in comparison with are rather incomparable because the efficiency of linear models at dealing with billions of such texts proven less accurate and which is probably another primary cnn and lstm are two popular dnn cnn is an effective feature whereas lstm suitable for modeling orderly sequence learning we also observe the use of lstm or gru with embeddings to fed into a cnn with to produce input vectors for a neural in the context of the text cnn extracts word or character and lstm learns a word or character dependencies in in is a robust architecture to capture dependencies between features extracted by cnn and found more effective than structures solely based on cnn or where the class of a word sequence depends on its preceding word while each type of network has relative few works have explored combining both architectures into a single except for a few restricted transfer learning settings that achieved higher classification accuracy than a single neural accurate identification of hate speech in bengali is still a challenging only a few restrictive approaches have been so romim et prepared a dataset of making it one of the largest datasets for identifying offensive and hateful this dataset has several it is very where the ratio of hate speech and speech ratio is the majority of the hate speech is shorter in length and word count compared to this study has several potential their approach merely achieved moderately high accuracy at identifying offensive or hateful giving an accuracy of their approach is methods without showing how predictions are ismam et collected hateful comments from facebook and annotated hateful they classified them into six classes  hate communal religious political and religious their approach based on dnn achieved an accuracy of making it not up to the in a recent we provided classification benchmarks for document sentiment and hate speech detection in the by combining fasttext embeddings with multichannel network is probably the first work among a few other studies on hate speech the architecture by combining fasttext embeddings performed much better compared to and glove as fasttext works well with rare words such that even if a word was not seen during the it can be broken down into to get its corresponding all of these restrictive approaches are methods without showing how a prediction is made by an interpretable methods put more emphasis on the transparency and traceability of opaque dnn for with relevance relevant parts of inputs and representations a neural network that caused a can be to mitigate such opaqueness and to improve explainability in hate speech binny et proposed and prepared a benchmark dataset for explainable hate speech based on sota they observe that high classification accuracy is not but also high on explainability is they measured the explainability of an nlp model in terms of plausibility and faithfulness that are based on human rationales for inspired by their study and sota interpretability techniques such as sensitivity and we propose a novel approach called for hate speech detection from bengali language with more reliably and in our bengali texts are first comprehensively before classifying them into and religious by employing a neural ensemble of different neural architectures such as monolingual bangla multilingual and we identify important terms with sa and lrp to provide we provide explanations of hate speech covering both global and local we measure the explainability of the hate speech detection in terms of two metrics called comprehensiveness and we trained several and baseline to the focus on algorithmic transparency and with the following we apply the sensitivity and relevance methods to a bidirectional lstm to identify the most and least important terms that are responsible for attributing specific types of

results on different nlp not much is known about how the encoderfusion in some other studies show that exploiting encoder representations fail to improve model in this we consolidate the conflicting conclusions of existing studies by pointing out that the encoder embedding layer is the which can help models to precisely predict target based on this we propose a novel surfacefusion to directly connecting the encoder embedding layer and the softmax which consistently outperform current encoderfusion approaches across different nlp of feature feature fusion aims to merge two sets of features

translation research this article reviewed widely used methods including data well we summarize resources tools useful nmt despite great success achieved still many problems we list important challenging problems nmt,is one of the most straightforward and reliable techniques to protect nmt systems from and studied its impact and showed how it needs to be utilized to boost adversarial training is another common solution to build proposed a method to construct adversarial examples for both source and target inputs are supposed to attack the model while adversarial target inputs help defend the translation in their a candidate word is replaced with its peer to introduce this the neural engine visits different forms of the same which extends its in other the network is trained to deliver the consistent functionality even though it is fed with different forms of a although this strategy showed promising in our settings we replace input words with real noisy candidates instead of synonyms or we find this way of adding noise more realistic and closer to experimented another idea by generating adversarial examples using synthetic their proposed architecture relies on transformers but the encoder is equipped with a convolutional model this work is one of the few attempts that studied behaviour in the presence of their results are based on relatively small we know that nmt performance could change proportionally with a change in the size of training the convolutional component also makes it hard to figure out how transformers deal with the application of adversarial training is not limited to the aforementioned defined additional loss functions which force the encoder and decoder to ignore perturbations and generate clean this idea is similar to our cd but the underlying architecture is only reported results on recurrent nmt providing better representations is as important as designing tailored training strategies for a group of researchers focused on how different segmentation schemes and encoding techniques can play a and showed that subwords are better alternatives than surface forms to handle perturbations and comprehensively studied this by using different and representations in different also carried out a similar investigation where they proposed a new encoding that is invariant to the order of besides these translating noisy inputs can be viewed as a process performed via two connected neural the first one acts as a monolingual translator to correct noisy inputs and the second one is an ordinary translation engine that consumes denoised sequences to generate clean translations this idea can be implemented as an differentiable solution or in a pipeline with multiple and segmented but it should be noted that such a mechanism could be hard to deploy or slow to run in
word embeddings represent words two languages shared semantically similar words different languages close early work focused jointly learning clwes two relying strong supervision form parallel corpora

selected natural noise find realistic among work extended noise models unique transformer we aim evaluate language,embedding methods learn static word representations based on statistics from a most approaches use two different matrices to represent the words and the which are known as the input and output respectively the output vectors play an auxiliary being discarded after our method takes advantage of this leveraging translated output vectors as anchor points to learn to that we build on the with negative sampling algorithm which trains a binary classifier to distinguish whether each output word with the given input word in the training corpus or was instead sampled from a noise clwe offline mapping methods separately train word embeddings for each and then learn a mapping to align them into a shared most of these methods align the embeddings through a linear enforcing orthogonality as they rely on the assumption that the geometric structure of the separately learned embeddings is this assumption has been shown to fail under unfavorable severely hindering the performance of these methods existing attempts to mitigate this issue include learning maps in a latent space employing maps that are only locally linear or learning a separate map for each word all these methods are and have the same fundamental limitation of aligning a set of separately trained embeddings while early mapping methods relied on a bilingual dictionary to learn the this requirement was alleviated thanks to which iteratively the dictionary during this enabled learning clwes in a fashion starting from a weak initial dictionary or in a completely unsupervised manner when combined with adversarial training or initialization heuristics our proposed method also incorporates a showing that this technique can also be effective with clwe before the popularization of offline most clwe methods extended monolingual embedding algorithms by either incorporating an explicit term in their learning or directly replacing words with their translation equivalents in the training for that these methods relied on some form of ranging from bilingual dictionaries to parallel or corpora more reported positive results learning regular word embeddings over concatenated monolingual corpora in different relying on identical words as anchor further improved this approach by applying a conventional mapping method as shown later in our our approach outperforms theirs by a large showed that it is possible to transfer an english transformer to a new language by freezing all the inner parameters of the network and learning a new set of embeddings for the new language through masked language this works because the frozen transformer parameters constrain the resulting representations to be aligned with our proposed approach uses frozen output vectors in the target language as anchor points to learn aligned embeddings in the source

focuses on transferring knowledge from external data to downstream tasks where labeled data is domain adaptation similarly focuses on changing data existing works focus on data within the same modality which simplifies the alignment alignment involves learning a joint space where the representations of the same concepts expressed in different modalities are close alignment is particularly useful for retrieval and representation several objective functions for learning aligned spaces from varying quantities of paired and unpaired data have been generalization is harder one has to learn not just the associations between modalities but also associations to there is weak supervision both the target modality and in the label space tasks in different modalities have different label and new tasks in the target modality have to be learned using only a few recent work has explored more general models that enable knowledge transfer across in data programming uses weak labels in a source modality to train a classifier in the target transfer learning aims to classify the same task from different input learning within target modalities has been shown to benefit from additional multimodal information during these all require labeled data from the target modality during in we study generalization which do not assume any labeled data in the target except during in a parallel studies how external information from another modality can help prediction in a source so both training and testing focuses on prediction in the source and is unable to solve problems in an unseen target to the best of our our approach is the first to tackle generalization from a source to target

stochastic processes in time point processes in time have allowed for clustering of document streams while writing this paper we found in which a rnn language model is conditioned on a global dynamic latent more and most closely related to our rnn language models have been conditioned on a global dynamic latent in contrast to this our dynamic representations explicitly encode both timing and content of past and can capture from the point of view of the datasets used in the within the recommender system realm deep neural networks models of review data for rating predictions use embedding

also recommend us to cite related work in visual common here is the recommendation to the best of my i think the most difference between these works and ours is that we leverage as a crucial knowledge for many artificial intelligence causality has long been an important research topic in many communities with different for in the machine learning researchers are focusing on modeling causality from structured data different from researchers from the computer vision community are focusing on identifying key objects or events in images that can cause certain decision last but not previous works in the natural language processing community are mostly working on acquiring causality knowledge via either or linguistic pattern mining and then applying the acquired knowledge for understanding human the ultimate goal of this paper is the same as previous nlp works that we are trying to acquire causality which can be stored and used for downstream but the approach is to the best of our this is the first work exploring the possibility of directly acquiring causality from the visual in this we first model the contextual property of causal which is common and vital in downstream another related work from the cv community is which asks models to identify if one image can cause the major difference is that our paper is trying to extract causality knowledge rather than leveraging external knowledge to predict image prior works on causality knowledge acquisition typically rely on crowdsourcing or linguistic pattern mining over textual besides these approaches that focus only on the causality based on the observation that there exist a strong correlation of temporal and causal relation between develops a joint training framework to learn temporal and causality knowledge one shared drawback of these previous works is that they did not take the contextual property of causal which is common and vital in real into to remedy this we propose a novel setting that simulates how human beings see the world and leverage the visual signal as context for better causality knowledge representation and as the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing nlp research topics are popular in both for image captioning aims at generating captions for images and scene graph generation tries to detect not just entities but also events or states from besides these basic some other nlp tasks and visual are also created to test how well models can understand human language and visual signals for visual question answering tests ability to answer questions given certain images and visual dialogue aims at understanding dialogues and generating suitable dialog response with the help of the visual different from these we are not focusing on a specific we are trying to mine knowledge which can be applied in downstream nlp from the visual another line of related works is visual commonsense which aim at either extracting commonsense knowledge from the images or evaluating commonsense reasoning abilities over considering that the causality often happens between events that appear in the temporal which are unlikely to appear in the same we choose to work on image pairs rather than a single

recent advances neural speech recognition made possible commercialize neural speech recognition systems,the relationship between training size and error rates or generalization loss has been studied in a variety of early research observed that accuracy varies roughly with the log of the training both in shallow ml approaches on a natural language disambiguation and in convolutional neural networks on an object detection noting the connection with learning curves observed during training on a large train have tried fitting a power law learning curve to the relationship between training

translation and lstms or transformers on language modeling provided that training size and model size are increased in in particular observe that a highly consistent power law relationship between loss and either of training size or model size persists across many orders of magnitude when not bottlenecked by the other of the our approach differs from this previous research by specifically investigating the effect of the compositional structure of a task on the training size to error rate the degree to which additional training data from a related domain can help or hurt performance has been investigated also in the context of and domain our experiments in section resemble the scenario of learning in that we aim to train a single model that can apply to multiple not just the single domain from which our test set is learning to improve performance on individual domains by explicitly distinguishing the domain of each example at train and test which is not our focus we expect that explicitly distinguishing domains would be less beneficial in the tasks than in scenarios where the expected output for a given input can differ depending on the domain but we would welcome investigation into the effectiveness of mdl techniques on as future our experiments in section can be considered a form of domain adaptation in that a model targeting a single domain is trained using a combination of and our approach corresponds most closely to the instance weighting particularly the batch weighting which found to yield superior performance over other instance weighting another popular da technique which we have not evaluated in our experiments is that of on a broader data set followed by on which may be augmented with selections from the data ranked by similarity to the in much attention has been paid recently to the significant improvements in performance achievable on a variety of downstream natural language tasks through of large scale language including in scenarios of domain adaptation and observe that the performance of can be improved on several reading comprehension benchmarks by additionally it on a selection of supervised examples from each of different large rc prior to finally it on the specific target in cases where the target dataset is they find that the additional from the other rc datasets improves performance only about half the show that applying additional on unlabeled examples from the target domain improves performance on a number of classification tasks compared to use of our approach differs from this previous research again by investigating the effect of varying amounts of supervised rather than unsupervised training using knowledge of the compositional structure of the task to characterize the relationship between the

natural language processing methods use embedded information design reaction our models able learn classification schemes using broad set chemical reactions labeled commercially available reaction classification with bert match classification accuracy,learning efficient acoustic representation can be traced back to restricted boltzmann machine which allows on large amounts of unlabeled data before training the deep neural network acoustic more acoustic representation learning has drawn increasing attention in speech processing and has shown promising results in speech as mentioned in the the key to a robust representation learning is the design of the proxy supervised most proxy tasks in acoustic representation learning can fall into two the first one is based on contrastive loss and has been applied to speech representation such as and its variants to train acoustic representation with contrastive an encoder network maps the original acoustic features into a latent a context network maps multiple latent representations into a contextualized the model is trained to learn representations containing information that most discriminates the future or masked frame from a set of negative samples via contrastive the second one is based on reconstructive the proxy task for these representation learning methods is to reconstruct temporal slices of acoustic these reconstruction tasks can be defined as autoregressive or apc and its are examples to use autoregressive reconstruction in many pretrained language model prediction is adopted in the proxy tasks such as bert and xlnet in instead of we randomly mask slices of acoustic features and attempt to reconstruct for an autoregressive predictive coding model was proposed in for unsupervised speech representation learning and was applied to phone classification and speaker wavenet proposed contrastive predictive coding to learn speech representations and was applied on unsupervised acoustic unit discovery proposed a convolutional neural network optimized via a noise contrastive binary classification and was applied to wsj asr as its is introduced where the contrastive task is defined over a quantized latent it was shown by training acoustic representation over unlabeled audio they were able to attain competitive performance on librispeech using only minutes of labeled similar idea has also been exploited to the apc where a apc model was decoar stands for deep contextualized acoustic and was proposed in our previous as depicted in decoar consists of two an encoder module and a reconstruction for an input speech sequence an encoder module consists of a stacked forward and backward and computes a hidden representation that encodes information from both previous and future frames for each temporal slice the reconstruction module takes the concatenated forward state at time and backward state at as and uses networks to recontruct each the decoar objective is defined as where is a network to reconstruct the frame in the the final loss is calculated over all possible slices in the entire sequence in an autoregressive defined is one of the successful examples in representation it uses minutes of labeled data with hours of unlabeled data to achieve a word error rate of on librispeech the model relies on a diverse codebook learned to correlate the underlying speech units to representations via contrastive discretizing the continuous representation enables applications of many nlp in after applying vq the model is trained using a masked lm style similar to one potential challenge in learning optimal codebooks with contrastive loss is posed by data with nuisance factors such as noise and other adverse in these the codebook can be trivially optimized by assigning acoustic condition to the a potential is to use frame reconstruction as objective so that the network can leverage all available information of the input feature to guide the learning of a robust another solution is to perform vector quantization operation at a higher layer as opposed to a lower flow back to the the codes to preserve meaningful helping mitigate the codebook learning problems in contrastive loss as discussed contrastive loss formulation can result in several locally optimal for acoustic codebooks in which the model can easily be optimized by assigning acoustic condition to the the and temporal codebooks in which the model assigns specific codes to fixed temporal locations for a minimum contrastive this codebook learning methodology using contrastive loss may not generalize well to all especially the real world data contained a lot of nuisance factor like adverse a simple is to use frame reconstruction as so the network allows information of the input feature flow back to the the codes to preserve meaningful helping mitigate the codebook learning problems in contrastive loss as discussed introduced an novel approach that inserted a vq layer before frame the motivation of using vq is to quantify the information needed to encode speech representation and control the capacity of the the model uses autoregressive predictive coding as instead of a contrastive predictive coding their experiments showed objective performed better than objective under the same they also demonstrated the learned vq codes highly correlate to phoneme suggesting vq can be used to capture linguistic units in an implicit since direct prediction make the model to utilize all the information available to achieved maximal while most of those information are not important to asr and also made the task and by utilizing the vq layer to limit the the model is able to focus on only a few certain their experiment also showed that apc objective performed better than cpc objective under the same orthogonal to the based representation representations of audio data has been the motivation is that enforcing the quantization leads to a better representation for acoustic unit discovery due to the discrete nature of phonetic also try to exactly quantified of information to control the capacity of the models and the use of vector quantization limited capacity are forced to retain information to achieve maximal despite the success of the model the model relies on a diverse codebook learnt to correlates the underlying speech units to speech representations via the contrastive the codes at each time step the model select right after feature encoder hardly contained meaningful phonetic more contrastive loss formulation can result in several locally optimal a few highly probable optima observed were acoustic where the model can easily optimized by assign acoustic condition to the the and temporally invariant where the model assigns specific codes to fixed temporal locations to enable a good contrastive the codebook learning methodology using contrastive loss might not generalize well to all espically the real world data consisted a lot of nausence factor like different recording a simple solution could be to enforce the codes to explicitly carry information about the input features in the using frame reconstruction as the network allows a flow of information from the input feature back to the the latent space to preserve meaningful helping mitigatate the codebook learning problems in contrastive loss as discussed we propose an novel model that learns vector quantized deep transformer acoustic representations based on frames since simple reconstruction utilize all the information available to achieved maximal prediction while those information are less relevant to and by utilizing the vq layer to limit those unwanted information flow into final vector quantized deep contextualized acoustic representations are able to achieve much better representation that is better suited for asr by using a large amount of unlabeled and then applies these representations to asr tasks using a limited amount of labeled in our we perform acoustic representation learning using deep transformer and a training objective that minimizes the reconstruction error of a temporal slice of filterbank features given context after we fix these parameters and add output layers with connectionist temporal classification loss for the asr we only train the small asr model instead of for our approach showed that supervision with hours of labeled data on decoar achieves performance on par with training on all hours to reconstruct each frame in the original for each slice starting at time and ending at the reconstruction module takes the and aims at reconstructing each frame decoar falls into the category of reconstructive loss based we train the decoar model to predict a slice of acoustic feature given past and future acoustic as depicted on the left side of a stack of forward and backward lstms are applied to the entire unlabeled input sequence where the are log filterbank the encoder network computes a hidden representation that encodes information from both previous and future frames for each frame given a sequence of acoustic feature inputs for each slice starting at time step our objective is defined as where are the concatenated forward and backward states from the last lstm and is a network with hidden the final loss is summed over all possible slices in the entire decoar consists of two a encoder network that encodes a temporal slice of filterbank features to train a deep lstm network encodes a temporal slice of filterbank features into a latent feature space in our previous work we proposed a different perspective towards speech recognition via representation a large amount of unlabeled data is used to train robust acoustic representation by reconstructing temporal slices of filterbank features from past and future context frames in an autoregressive this acoustic representation is referred to as deep contextualized acoustic or decoar in the labeled data is then applied with the which is used to train an asr we observed highly comparable performance using limited amount of the labeled data using decoar compared to using the entire conventional filterbank features on librispeech in speech similar ideas have been those speech representations fall into these contrastive predictive coding incorporates contrastive objective to learn representations containing information that most discriminates the future or masked frame from a set of negative another approach is autoregressive predictive coding which tries to directly predict or reconstruct the frame based on more representations of audio data has drawn increasing attention in speech processing the motivation is that enforcing the quantization leads to a better representation for acoustic unit discovery due to the discrete nature of phonetic also try to exactly quantified of information to control the capacity of the and the use of vector quantization limited capacity are forced to retain information to achieve maximal despite the success of the model the model relies on a diverse codebook learnt to correlates the underlying speech units to speech representations via the contrastive the codes at each time step the model select right after feature encoder hardly contained meaningful phonetic more contrastive loss formulation can result in several locally optimal a few highly probable optima observed were acoustic where the model can easily optimized by assign acoustic condition to the the and temporally invariant where the model assigns specific codes to fixed temporal locations to enable a good contrastive the codebook learning methodology using contrastive loss might not generalize well to all espically the real world data consisted a lot of nausence factor like different recording a simple solution could be to enforce the codes to explicitly carry information about the input features in the using frame reconstruction as the network allows a flow of information from the input feature back to the the latent space to preserve meaningful helping mitigatate the codebook learning problems in contrastive loss as discussed we propose an novel model that learns vector quantized deep transformer acoustic representations based on frames since simple reconstruction utilize all the information available to achieved maximal prediction while those information are less

representation learning using deep transformer and a training objective that minimizes the reconstruction error of a temporal slice of filterbank features given context after we fix these parameters
