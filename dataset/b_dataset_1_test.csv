social media become essential element society people communicate exchange information daily the strong influence social media internet users great benefit many many companies organizations nowadays use social media reach promote ensure customer despite benefits associated widespread use social remain vulnerable informal structure platforms contributed spread harmful violent although social media service providers policies control rules rarely followed social media providers also allow users report inappropriate unreported content may discovered due huge volume data some countries restricted use social others taken legal action regarding violent harmful content might target particular individuals violations might end unpunished due anonymous nature allowing users fearlessly share harmful content using nicknames fake one harmful content social media hate might take different forms hate speech expression justifies discrimination person group individuals based characteristics sexual online hate speech rapidly increasing entire nearly world    population communicates social studies shown nearly americans experienced online hate this result higher results comparable questionnaire conducted for younger results show teenagers frequently encounter hate speech social one dangerous influential forms online hate speech led spread supporters extreme ideologies target racial groups white supremacists one ideological groups believe people white race superior dominant people also referred white nationalism radical white supremacists claim undermined dark skin multicultural want restore white people    violently they also claimed responsibility many violent incidents happened including bank the white supremacist ideology adopted extremists combine white supremacy political white supremacist hate speech become significant threat either influencing young people hateful ideas creating movements implement goals real a study also suggested links hate speech hate crimes others several recent brutal attacks also committed supporters radical white supremacists active members social the mass shootings new norway committed white supremacists shared opinions ideologies

section detailed description methods methodology section details used datasets dataset section specifications methodologies results approach experiments results section observations analysis performance approach discussion section conclusion future work section,white supremacists embrace a radical ideology that considers white people superior to people of other the critical influence of these groups is no longer limited to social they also have a significant effect on society in many ways by promoting racial hatred and white supremacist hate speech is one of the most recently observed harmful content on social traditional channels of reporting hate speech have proved inadequate due to the tremendous explosion of and it is necessary to find an automatic way to detect such speech in a timely this research investigates the viability of automatically detecting white supremacist hate speech on twitter by using deep learning and natural language processing through our we used two the first approach is by using embeddings which are extracted from white supremacist corpus in order to catch the meaning of this white supremacist slang with bidirectional long memory deep learning this approach reached a the second approach is by using the one of the most recent language model which is bert model provides the state of the art of most nlp it reached to a both approaches are tested on a balanced dataset given that our experiments were based on textual data the dataset was combined from dataset created from twitter and a stormfront dataset compiled from that white

as computer natural language and speech the processes of these models are generally not interpretable to in various such as or it is critical to know the reasons behind a decision made by an artificial intelligence several directions for explaining neural models have recently been in this i investigate two major directions for explaining deep neural the first direction consists of explanatory that methods that aim to explain an already trained and fixed model and that provide explanations in terms of input such as tokens for text and superpixels for images the second direction consists of neural models that generate natural language that models that have a module that generates explanations for the predictions of the the contributions in these directions are as in this i investigate the topic of explaining deep neural this topic is crucial nowadays as neural model are becoming more and more employed in applications due to their high performance in diverse such as computer natural language and speech the processes learned by these models are not generally in various such as or criminal it is critical to know the reasons behind a decision made by an artificial intelligence several directions for explaining neural models have recently been a series of methods have recently been developed to provide explanations for the predictions of neural this thesis brings contributions to two major directions for explaining deep neural explanatory methods and neural models that generate natural language explanations for their the contributions are as it is still an open question how to verify whether the explanations provided by these methods are faithfully describing the processes of the models that they aim to it is also an open question whether neural networks can learn from natural language explanations for the labels at training as well as support their predictions with natural language explanations at test just like humans i reveal certain difficulties of explaining even trivial models using only input i show despite the apparent implicit assumption that explanatory methods should look for one specific there is often more than one such explanation for a i also show that two prevalent classes of explanatory methods target different types of explanations without explicitly mentioning i show neither of these explanations is enough to provide a complete view of a process on an findings can have an important impact on how users choose explanatory methods to best suit their i introduce a framework for automatically verifying the faithfulness with which explanatory methods describe the processes of the models that they aim to this framework relies on the use of a particular type of model that is expected to provide insight into its i analyse potential limitations of this approach and introduce ways to alleviate the introduced verification framework is generic and can be instantiated on different tasks and domains to provide sanity tests that can be used to test explanatory i instantiate this framework on a task of sentiment analysis and provide sanity sanity tests are available at test any explanatory on which i present the performances of three popular explanatory results show that these methods may provide unfaithful also discuss ways in which the current limitations of the framework can further be addressed to lead to more robust and flexible the process of developing this i uncover several ways in which a particular type of model that is expected to provide insight into its process can provide

explanatory methods on these which raise awareness of the unfaithful explanations that these methods may discuss ways in which the limitations of this verification framework can further be addressed and open the path towards more robust and flexible verification frameworks that can be adapted to this framework relies on the use of a particular type of model that is expected to provide insight

towards more robust and flexible verification frameworks that can be adapted to improve their behaviour and performance improved behaviour if they are additionally given natural language explanations for the label at training time to explore the direction of neural models that generate natural language explanations for their i collected a large dataset of natural language explanations on top of the influential stanford natural language inference i call this dataset dataset is publicly available at which i release dataset is available at advance research in the direction of training with and generation of natural language i provide empirical evidence that models generating correct explanations are more reliable than models that just predict the correct i also train different neural models that generate natural language explanations at test and i measure the success of these models to generate correct i also investigate whether the presence of natural language explanations at training time can lead a model to produce better universal sentence representations and to perform better on i do a series of experiments that investigate both the capabilities of neural models to generate correct natural language explanations at test and the benefits of providing natural language explanations at training i show that current models that generate natural language explanations for their own predictions may generate inconsistent such as is a dog in the and is no dog in the inconsistent explanations reveal either that the explanations are not faithfully describing the process of the model or that the model learned a flawed i introduce a simple yet effective adversarial framework for sanity checking models against the generation of inconsistent natural language as part of the i address the problem of adversarial attacks with exact target a scenario that was not previously addressed in and which can be useful for other tasks in natural language i apply the framework on a state of the art neural model on and show that this model can generate a significant number of this work paves the way for obtaining more robust neural models accompanied by faithful explanations for their hope is that in the future explanatory methods will be superseded by robust and accurate neural models that faithfully explain themselves to their human users in natural

contextualized representations bert positively affects ability solve nli downstream bert stores information representations higher capacity predicting correct,in this paper we investigate the linguistic knowledge learned by a neural language model before and after a process and how this knowledge affects its predictions during several classification we use a wide set of probing each of which corresponds to a distinct feature extracted from different levels of linguistic we show that bert is able to encode a wide range of linguistic but it tends to lose this information when trained on specific downstream we also find that bert capacity to encode different kind of linguistic properties has a positive influence on its the more it stores readable linguistic information of a the higher will be its capacity of predicting the expected label assigned to that

leads to different learning difficulties for tokens in neural machine translation the vanilla nmt model usually adopts trivial objectives for target tokens with different frequencies and tends to generate more tokens and less tokens compared with the golden token tokens may carry critical semantic information that will affect the translation quality once they are in this we explored target

design a label which estimates the source reliability using a conditional soft attention mechanism and then reduces label noise by aggregating weak the denoised pseudo labels then supervise a neural classifier to predicts soft labels for unmatched which address the rule coverage to address these we propose an model with two key components sentence is not informative need to deliver the key idea of our method in one sentence and then use the remaining sentences to elaborate our the first component is a rule which estimates conditional source reliability using a soft attention mechanism and reduces label noise by aggregating weak the second is a neural classifier that predicts soft labels for unmatchable samples to address the rule coverage two components are integrated into a which can be trained to mutually enhance each we evaluate our model on five benchmarks for and relation the results show that our model outperforms and methods and achieves comparable performance with methods

by human summarizers and annotators contain implicit information about their background we develop and compare techniques for inferring background knowledge from summarization based on this we define summary scoring functions that explicitly model background and show that these scoring functions fit human judgments significantly better than we illustrate some of the many potential applications of our we provide insights into human information importance we demonstrate that averaging the background knowledge of potentially biased annotators or corpora greatly improves scoring we discuss potential applications of our framework beyond we apply our models in a simple yet effective summarization

research attention in natural language most existing works do not fully address the sparse relationships between entities and which loses this important information and thus deteriorates the extraction to mitigate this we first define the as a labeling task with a tag set composed of tags of triggers and to incorporate the missing information in the aforementioned we propose a to alternately supervise the extraction of either triggers or entities based on the type distribution of each since the connected entities and triggers naturally form a heterogeneous information network we leverage the latent pattern along for a given corpus to further improve the performance of our proposed to verify the effectiveness of our proposed we conduct extensive experiments on four datasets as well as compare our method with empirical results and analysis show that our approach outperforms the methods in both entity and trigger

general method inducing event complex comprehensively represents relational structure several related event two this supported memberships vertically identified well horizontal temporal reasoning within event as far different previous works formulated relations along single our model demonstrates potent capability inducing event complexes promising performance evaluated red dataset,think that the current version is too detailed and does not position the work at it just says what is being here is a understanding natural language involves recognizing how multiple event mentions structurally and temporally interact with each in this one can induce event complexes that organize events with temporal order and membership relations interweaving among due to the lack of jointly labeled data for these relational phenomena and the restriction on the structures they we propose a joint constrained learning framework for modeling the framework enforces logical constraints within and across multiple temporal and subevent relations events by converting these constraints into differentiable learning we show that our joint constrained learning approach effectively compensates for the lack of jointly labeled and outperforms sota methods on benchmarks for both temporal relation extraction and event hierarchy replacing a commonly used but more expensive global inference we also present a promising case study showing the effectiveness of our approach in inducing event complexes on an external code is publicly available at this contradict the statement above regarding the lack of joint do we need to address it we need the next you show that you do not need but it reads like you just do not use if you really want to keep maybe better to say replacing a commonly more global inference even without global inference that is widely used in previous events described in natural language text requires a reader to identify how they structurally and to form an event most of the work in nlp has focused on predicate mentions and not on the event complex they form in this paper we study the induction of larger event units from text identifying a set of predicate mentions that together via and subevent form event the scarcity of jointly labeled data for these relational phenomena presents a significant technical these phenomena interact with each thus restricting the structures they to make this we propose a joint learning framework that enforces logical constraints among the relations to be by converting these into differentiable learning we show that not only does our joint training approach address the lack of jointly labeled but it also outperforms sota results on both the temporal benchmark data set and the event hierarchy benchmark data also present a promising case study on a dataset with fully annotated we study temporal and hierarchical relations of events using a joint constrained learning first obtain the event representation via an and then jointly train a perceptron to predict confidence scores for temporal and hierarchical relations before we make structured prediction via integer linear programming the framework first incorporates a contextualized encoder to characterize the events in the and then predicts the confidence scores for temporal and hierarchical relations among in the training our framework learns to enforce logic consistency among various types of event relations in both by converting declarative rules into differentiable learning objective the consistency of final prediction is enforced by global inference inference phase performs structured prediction based on integer linear programming to respect the corresponding logic constraints of utilize the benchmark dataset for the extraction task of each category of relations for training and experimental we prove the feasibility of joint constrained learning of different tasks using datasets that have partial annotations for each the labor for creating another dataset that has full the experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms the method on the benchmark of event temporal relation extraction task by and it improves over the model of training jointly without constraints by on hieve a benchmark for event hierarchy the joint constrained learning effectively bridges the tasks with limited annotated learning and promisingly leverages domain

hatespeech in large scale inspired by the recent success of the bert we propose several modifications to bert to enhance the performance on the downstream hatespeech classification inherits bert but is different in four it generates its own vocabularies and is from the scratch using the largest scale hatespeech it consists of factorized resulting in a much smaller number of faster training and as well as less memory it uses our proposed ensemble heads with a pooling layer for separate input to further enhance its and it uses a regularized adversarial training with our proposed and adaptive noise magnitude to enhance its through experiments on the hatespeech dataset with annotated we show that works better than hatespeech detection including language in comparing with our is times faster in the uses less than of the and has better even though we it by using less than of the number of our generalizability analysis shows that transfers well to other unseen hatespeech datasets and is a more efficient and effective alternative to bert for the hatespeech code and the pretrained models are available at

protocol presented followed results section concludes paper presents,effectiveness of language generation models conditioned by structured data is inherently due to the quality of reference texts and the training these reference texts often diverge from the information contained in the associated source data in language generation models conditioned by structured the classical training via maximum likelihood almost always leads models to pick up on dataset divergence and to incorporate them erroneously in their own generations at this we propose a reinforcement learning framework in order to reduce hallucinations and to do we rely on the recently introduced parent metric assessing the adequacy of a candidate generation with both the human reference and the source in this we build ontop of previous reinforcement learning based approaches and show that a framework relying on the recently introduced parent metric is efficient at reducing both hallucinations and evaluations on the widely used wikibio and webnlg benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework compared to

paper aims to enhance the relation classification especially for sentences that jointly describe multiple due to the fact that some relations usually keep high in the same previous relation classifiers struggle to distinguish them with few annotated to alleviate the above relation confusion we propose a model equipped with two mechanisms to learn to decouple these on the one an attention which leverages the syntactic relations and relative positions between each word and the specified entity is introduced to guide the attention to filter out information causing on the other a training method is proposed to explicitly learn to distinguish relations by playing a game between classifying a sentence into a true relation and its confusing extensive experiments are conducted on the fewrel and the results show that our proposed model achieves comparable and even much better results to strong baselines in terms of the ablation test and case study verify the effectiveness of our

powerful expressivity due following two representation usually mention surrounded words most work tries learn mention representations extracting features merely particular sentence including we argue routine representation learning coreference match end task coping relation recognition mention the predicted relation input mention pair rather individual by different two mentions referring to fit different mention learn representation considering counterpart unstructured representation an event mention consists multiple arguments describe most prior work tried encode elements single distributed representation vector compare vectors two this less optimal since humans recognize objects often compare event arguments type event locations people make judgement quickly even without comparing mention denoting mention single distributed vector lets machines lose opportunity conduct reasoning humans uneasy explain model to promote expressivity work proposes pairwise structured

performing we report event coreference entity coreference despite simple surpasses prior sota system big,of events and of entities are commonly formulated as binary classification given a pair of events or entities as earlier work addressed the main challenge in these problems the representation of each element in the input pair modelling the representation of one element without considering the other element in the encoding all attributes of one element into a single thus losing the ability to compare in this work we propose paired representation learning for coreference in this work we propose pairwise structured representation learning we want to change the model since it is not structured for and for most numbers are from trigger only just pairedrl if we can cahange pairwise structure to in the title and the rest of the coreference given a pair of elements our model treats the pair sentences as a single sequence so that each element in the pair learns its representation by encoding its own context as well the other element in when representing is structured in that it represents the event arguments to facilitate their individual contribution to the final as we in both event and entity coreference our unified outperforms prior state of the art systems with a large a pair of elements our model treats the pair sentences as a single sequence so that each element in the pair learns its representation by encoding its own context as well the other element in when representing is structured in that it represents the event arguments to facilitate their individual contribution to the final as we in both event and entity coreference our unified outperforms prior state of the art systems with a large we want to emphasize the structure part in the the contribution of structured is relatively work studies the event and entity coreference which is commonly formulated as a binary classification problem given a pair of events or the main challenge lies in the representation learning of each element in the input prior work mostly has the following systems model the representation of one object with no consideration of the other object in the systems often encode all related attributes of one object into a single and unexplainable this reduces the model interpretability and mismatches the fact that humans tend to recognize the event relations by comparing we propose pairwise structured representation learning we want to change the model since it is not structured for and for most numbers are from trigger only for coreference by treats sentences of the input pair as a whole sequence so that each object in the pair learns its representation by encoding its own context as well the other this paradigm applies to both event and entity in develops a framework to represent all the event arguments so that each argument can explain its contribution to the final in both event and entity coreference beats prior state of the art systems

integrated into deep learning models to produce the performance for these models tend to compute the vectors without considering the aspect terms and fail to benefit from the overall contextual importance scores of the words that can be obtained from the dependency tree for in this we propose a novel deep learning model to overcome these two issues of the prior work on in our gate vectors are generated from the representation vectors of the aspect terms to customize the hidden vectors of the models toward the aspect in we propose a mechanism to obtain the importance scores for each word in the sentences based on the dependency trees that are then injected into the model to improve the representation vectors for the proposed model achieves the performance on three benchmark models employ graph based neural nets to incorporate syntactical structure into the they ignore the aspect term information to control the interaction between words in the syntax tree which is modeled by graph neural they neglect the consistency between the syntactic and semantic importance of the words toward the given the relative importance of the words to the given aspect term based on their syntactical role is neglected in the final representation produced by the existing to address these two in this we introduce a new model which incorporates gating mechanism to control information flow in the graph based model using the given aspect it also ensures the words that are syntactically important to the aspect term are more pronounced in the final representation of the our extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets empirically prove the effectiveness of the proposed model leading to new results on all three benchmark

domain adaptation common application scenario continual learning nmt drawn much attention under the translation quality drops quickly distribution training data it suffers catastrophic forgetting continual training,machine translation always suffers catastrophic forgetting during the continual learning process which means the model tends to forget all its previously learned knowledge when further trained with new data with different like from different domains or it is not clear what happens during this process and what causes this more it is not clear whether this is due to the overall change of the model or the impact of certain in this we focus on the domain adaptation task of nmt under the continual learning we put forward two ways for evaluating the importance of the parameters and show that the translation quality mainly dependents on the most important parameters of the then we analyze the behavior of the parameters according to their importance for the model during the continual learning process and it shows that the important parameters for the translation still play major roles for the translation after the continual learning what is the catastrophic forgetting shown as the substantial decline of translation quality with the rise of translation is mainly due to the change of these important we propose some practical methods to overcome the catastrophic forgetting by controlling the updates of parameters differently based on their neural machine translation models usually suffer from catastrophic forgetting during continual training where the models tend to gradually forget previously learned knowledge and swing to fit the newly added data which may have a different a different although many methods have been proposed to solve this we cannot get to know what causes this phenomenon under the background of domain we investigate the cause of catastrophic forgetting from the perspectives of modules and parameters the investigation on the modules of the nmt model shows that some modules have tight relation with the knowledge while some other modules are more essential in the domain and the investigation on the parameters shows that some parameters are important for both the and translation and the great change of them during continual training brings about the performance decline in we conduct experiments across different language pairs and domains to ensure the validity and reliability of our tracing parameter variation in this progress and depict the influence of different model depict the relationship between them so that we can work out solutions to the catastrophic forgetting problem based on these the background of domain adaptation for machine we found that some parameters play an essential role in both general domain and translation and the change of them brings about the performance decline in based on these we propose a solution to detect these important parameters and accordingly suppress their fluctuation during domain experimental results prove our method can greatly improve the translation quality in and meanwhile minimize the negative influences on

model on a labeled dataset using loss has several shortcomings that can lead to generalization and driven by the intuition that good generalization requires capturing the similarity between examples in one class and contrasting them with examples in other we propose a supervised contrastive learning objective for the combined with the scl loss we propose obtains improvements over a strong baseline on multiple datasets of the glue benchmark in both the and and it does not require any specialized data augmentation of any memory or additional unsupervised in all of our we use a very competitive baseline of roberta large using cross entropy loss on the labeled task rte and method outperforms the baseline on multiple datasets in the glue benchmark including rte and qnli for the full dataset we also show the effectiveness of our regularization for learning and demonstrate we also demonstrate the robustness of the learned representations by using noisy and show that the learned representations are more transferable to related we also demonstrate that the new objective leads to models that are more robust to different levels of noise in the training and can generalize

approaches learn embeddings of text and network structure by enforcing embeddings of connected nodes to be then for achieving a modality fusion they use the similarities between text embedding of a node with the structure embedding of its connected node and vice for achieving modality fusion they model similarities involving networks structure and textual attributes of nodes in an this implies that these approaches require edge information for learning embeddings and they cannot learn embeddings of unseen in this paper we propose an approach that achieves both modality fusion and the capability to learn embeddings of unseen the main feature of our model is that it uses an adversarial mechanism between text embedding based and structure embedding based generator to learn efficient then for learning embeddings of unseen we use the supervision provided by the text embedding based in addition we propose a novel architecture for learning text embedding that can combine both mutual attention and topological attention which give more flexible text through extensive experiments on we demonstrate that our model makes substantial gains over several in comparison with previous it

experimental concludes,stickers with vivid and engaging expressions are becoming increasingly popular in online messaging and some works are dedicated to automatically select sticker response by matching the stickers image with previous existing methods usually focus on measuring the matching degree between the dialog context and sticker which ignores the user preference of using in this we propose to recommend an appropriate sticker to user based on dialog context and sticker using history of two main challenges are confronted in this one is to model the sticker preference of user based on the previous sticker selection another challenge is to jointly fuse the user preference and the matching between dialog context and candidate sticker into final prediction to tackle these we propose a preference enhanced sticker response selector pesrs first employs a convolutional based sticker image encoder and a based dialog encoder to obtain the representation of stickers and deep interaction network is proposed to conduct deep matching between the sticker and each we model the user preference by using the recently selected stickers as and use a memory network to store the

depression detection for healthcare workers to have access to resources for case management and referral to it is necessitate to enable and sustainable depressive disorder and this study aims to design and evaluate a decision support system to determine the depressive triage level by capturing depressive symptoms appearing in depressed users tweets through emulating the clinically adopted patient health the limitation on characters imposed by twitter incentivize the usage of creative artifacts that are widely observed in the utterance of depressive figurative such as and sarcasm forms a general fabric of communication as it permit users to express their health condition more and inspired by we proposed a novel bert based learning framework that learns to accurately identify the symptoms using the auxiliary task of figurative language we propose a new task sharing aware which helps the model to borrow the new information across the with the help of of the our framework automatically detect and select optimal information across the layers of the that are useful for a task at the obtained results proves that modeling figurative language in depressive user tweets can improve the model learning ability in correctly distinguishing the our proposed approach achieve statistically significant improvements over the models on our primary

existing neural models use document representation as input followed by variational inference and learn distribution through reconstructing such methods have mainly focused on analysing the effect of enforcing suitable priors on document little importance has been given to encoding improved document features for capturing document semantics in this we propose a novel which models document as a sequence of tokens instead of bow at the input layer and processes it through an lstm whose output is used to perform variational inference followed by bow we apply attention on lstm outputs to empower the model to attend on relevant words which convey topic related we hypothesise that attention can be performed effectively if done in a topic guided manner and establish this empirically through we factor in distribution to perform topic aware attention achieving results with percentage improvement over score of existing sota topic models in npmi coherence metric on four benchmark

target side pay attention source knowledge distillation another relevant research kd preliminary designed improve weak student model much stronger teacher by boosts performance base models comparable even weaker unsupervised machine also seen utilizing target side monolingual to best first framework correct bias model fully utilize monolingual data source side more advantages framework diverse parameterized networks summarized through extensive achieves significant gains several standard translation tasks including also found much weaker learners could even outperform strong bert enhanced nmt model big,neural machine has achieved great success with the help of large amount of parallel different model architectures have different advantages and translation but it is hard to integrate them all together to one the ensemble method is too for monolingual data are also not fully some works such as and unsupervised machine translation have tried to utilize monolingual data of target whereas the utilization of source side monolingual data still need be further in this we propose a framework with diverse teachers to make one model be able to learn advantages and diversities from other and monolingual data of source side language can also be utilized to further improve the translation this method is very simple but much empirical results show that our method can obtain further improvements on the standard and translation despite the recent success on image has only achieved limited gains on structured prediction tasks such as neural machine translation this is mainly due to the compositionality of the target where the prediction hypotheses lead to the notorious reinforced mistake in this we revisit the utilization of multiple diverse models and present a simple yet effective approach named learning first exploits individual models to generate pseudo parallel and then cooperatively trains each model on the combined synthetic leverages the fact that different parameterized models have different inductive and better predictions can be made by jointly exploiting the agreement among each unlike the previous knowledge distillation methods built upon a much stronger is capable of boosting the accuracy of one model by introducing other comparable or even weaker can also be viewed as a more efficient alternative to extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of on several benchmarks with significant is available at takes advantage of different parameterized networks to generate diverse proper pseudo parallel and then dramatically reduce the bias through strategic combination of the pseudo we first train several nmt teachers with heterogeneous then use the heterogeneous teacher models to label unlabeled data respectively and finally use the labeled data and unlabeled data to jointly train a student nmt is very simple but much empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of on several where we even outperforms a strong ensemble which strategically aggregates multiple models for has been shown effective to improve the accuracy of neural machine translation in practice it cannot be widely adopted due to the high computation and memory cost for involving all individual transductive method has been proposed to overcome this suffers the premise that the test data has to be available in in this we present a simple yet effective approach named cooperative training nmt where we firstly use individual models to translate the source corpus into pseudo parallel and then cooperatively train all models on the translated synthetic leverages the fact that different parameterized models have different inductive and better predictions can be made by jointly exploiting the independence between each given source monolingual enables us to avoid the reinforced mistakes problem of and make the most of the monolingual extensive experiments demonstrate our proposed approach can always achieve superior or comparable performance on several benchmarks with less computational

we summarize contribution,keyphrase generation is the task of generating central topics from a given document or literary which captures the crucial information necessary to understand the documents such as scientific literature contain rich which represents the structure of the previous approaches ignore the constraints of document logical and hence they mistakenly generate keyphrases from unimportant to address this we propose a new method called sentence selective network to incorporate the inductive bias into in we use a estimator for training and incorporate weak supervision in the training of the sentence selection experimental results show that sensenet can consistently improve the performance of major kg models based on which demonstrate the effectiveness of capturing structural information and distinguishing the significance of sentences in kg

a common form of human it is hard to define appropriate questions to elicit more specific intents from a in this we propose a reinforcement model to clarify ambiguous questions by suggesting refinements of the original we first formulate a collection partitioning problem to select a set of labels enabling us to distinguish potential unambiguous we list the chosen labels as intent phrases to the user for further the selected label along with the original user query then serves as a refined for which a suitable response can more easily be the model is trained using reinforcement learning with a deep policy we evaluate our model based on user clicks and demonstrate significant improvements across several different the ability to ask clarification questions to solve ambiguity and missing information phenomena is essential for question answering the current research mainly uses questions generation or questions ranking to ask a clarification which lead to low success rate and redundant insufficient use of the graphic user interface results in more interactions with there is usually no guarantee for replying the user after the to solve these we propose a question clarification method based on intents intents are extracted from the historical frequently asked questions of our the recommended intents can provide more concise candidates for user to once an intent is the system guaranteed to provide a clear question list relative to the real we use the reinforcement learning method to recommend and the most challenging problem is cold the reward is designed to recommend the most relevant clear question list and maximize the information gain after clicking one intent for better question the method we proposed for question clarification can solve both

makes learning in modalities particularly in this we propose algorithms for a learning paradigm to train a model that can quickly perform new tasks in a target modality and doing so while being trained on a different source we study a key research how can we ensure generalization across modalities despite using separate encoders for different source and target our solution is based on a novel method to align representation spaces using strongly and weakly paired data while ensuring quick generalization to new tasks across different we study this problem on classification text to image to and text to our results demonstrate strong performance even when the new target modality has only a few labeled samples and in the presence of noisy a scenario particularly prevalent in vast differences in these raw humans seamlessly perceive multimodal learn new and show extraordinary capabilities in generalizing across input our method works particularly well when the target modality suffers from noisy or limited a scenario particularly prevalent in sometimes outperforming within modality baselines that have seen thousands of labeled examples from that target modality during heterogeneous since we are assuming there is an underlying shared so maybe not since this is the first sentence in the maybe remove truly general artificial intelligence systems must learn to generalize across multiple input modalities and output this we define and propose algorithms for a new notion of and believe that our proposed methods could open new doors towards better generalization in multimodal ai

knowledge is crucial for many artificial intelligence conventional causality knowledge acquisition methods typically require laborious and expensive human as a their scale is often as no context is provided during the the resulting causality knowledge records typically do not take the context into to explore a more scalable way of acquiring causality in this we jump out of the textual domain and investigate the possibility of learning contextual causality from the visual compared with pure learning causality from the visual signal has the following causality knowledge belongs to the commonsense which is rarely expressed in the text but rich in most events in the video are naturally which provides a rich resource for us to mine causality knowledge all the objects in the video can be used as context to study the contextual property of causal in we first propose a dataset and then conduct experiments to demonstrate that with good language and visual representation models as well as enough training it is possible to automatically discover meaningful causal knowledge from the further analysis also shows that the contextual property of causal relations indeed taking which into consideration might be crucial if we want to use the causality knowledge in real and the visual signal could serve as a good resource for learning such contextual and all used codes are available in we first identify events from the which are represented with natural and then leverage the visual signal to predict the contextual causal relations among these in this we mimic how human beings learn causality and explore the possibility of acquiring causality knowledge with visual to do we first define the task of mining contextual causality knowledge from visual which aims at evaluating abilities to identify causal relation given certain visual and then employ the to annotate a dataset on top of we propose a causal model that can utilize the images as context to better acquire

using limited amount labeled in perform acoustic representation learning using deep transformer training objective minimizes reconstruction error temporal slice filterbank features given context after fix parameters add output layers connectionist temporal classification loss asr we train small asr model instead our approach showed supervision hours labeled data decoar achieves performance par training hours,recent success in speech representation learning enables a new way to leverage unlabeled data to train speech recognition in speech representation a large amount of unlabeled data is used in a manner to learn a feature then a smaller amount of labeled data is used to train a downstream asr system using the new feature based on our previous work decoar and inspirations from other speech representation we propose decoar a deep contextualized acoustic representation with vector we introduce several modifications over the we use transformers in encoding module instead of we introduce a vector quantization layer between encoder and reconstruction we propose an objective that combines the reconstructive loss with vector quantization diversity loss to train speech our experiments show consistent improvements over other speech representations in different without a asr model trained on hours of librispeech labeled data with decoar features outperforms the model trained on the full dataset with filterbank we propose a novel approach for vector quantized deep contextualized acoustic following the same schema in we first exploit a large amount of unlabeled audio data via representation where we reconstruct a temporal slice of filterbank features from context the new resulting deep contextualized acoustic vector quantized representations are then used to train a small asr system using a small amount of labeled audio in our we show that systems trained on decoar consistently outperform ones trained on other acoustic giving the and comparable results with on experiments on our approach can drastically reduce the amount of labeled data unsupervised training on librispeech then supervision with hours of labeled data achieves performance on par with training on all hours
