"Never-ending information generation sharing Web provides us abundant data, constitute unstructured text sources. To better make sense draw associations among data, we, human beings, use relational facts among subjects text. For comprehensive understanding specific domains bioinformatics, finance, social networking etc., need computers process information. It essential represent information delivered text machine-readable format. One way represent entities relations called triples, indicate unambiguous facts entities. A triple implies entity relation another entity . Knowledge graphs FreeBase DBpedia examples representations. They directed labeled graph structured data aim express explicit semantics relations entities triple form. Relation extraction sub-task natural language processing aims discover relations entity pairs given unstructured text data. Earlier work relation extraction text heavily relies kernel based feature based methods .However, recent research studies make use data-driven deep learning methods eliminating conventional NLP approaches relation extraction. \citet{kumar2017survey} explained conventional deep learning methods integrated relation extraction. \citet{smirnova2018relation} reviewed relation extraction literature focusing distant supervision. As number research studies relation extraction increases, need survey current state-of-the-art neural relation extraction methods arises. This work provides comprehensive comparative review research field, focusing challenges together improvement ideas. Section explains various approaches relation extraction. In section neural relation extraction methods classified terms data supervision explained. Section describes existing challenges field research. In section , commonly used datasets model assessment evaluated. We discuss possible future research directions improvement ideas section conclude survey section . In paper, provided review transfer learning natural language processing. We discussed possible language models, datasets, tasks tackled research related transfer learning. Moreover, provided taxonomy transfer learning divides inductive transductive transfer learning. We divided category multiple levels collected related papers corresponding category. Although might different definitions literature, tried best incorporate best definition agreed upon across different studies. In general, see compared RNN-based CNN-based language models, seems attention-based models much dominant literature. Additionally, see BERT seems defacto architecture language modelling appears many tasks. This due bidirectional architectures makes successful many down-stream tasks. Regarding transfer learning, sequential fine-tuning seems dominant literature compared approaches like zero-shot. Moreover, seems mutli-task fine tuning gaining attention last years. As stated many studies, training multiple tasks time give much better results. Regarding datasets, text classification datasets seem widely used compared tasks NLP. This due fact easier fine-tune models tasks. For future research, make observations outlooks field transfer learning NLP. For specific tasks like sentiment classification, abstractive question answering, parts-of-speech tagging, recommend using bidirectional models like BERT. On hand, generative tasks like summarization, generative question answering, text generation, etc. recommend using models like GPT-2, T5 similar architectures. We also believe transfer learning techniques underrated like zero-shot seems perform really well multiple tasks . Moreover, adapter modules replace sequential fine-tuning perform equally good provide faster compact models compared traditional fine tuning. Finally, language models keep getting bigger bigger, believe research put trying reduce size models make deploy-able embedded devices web. Deploying knowledge distillation techniques prove useful circumstances reducing size large language models. Irfan: I would suggest add section point recommendations/best practices possible future works short term long term. Other paper looks good shape. Irfan: Is popular NLP task transfer learning researched?"," Neural relation extraction discovers semantic relations between entities from unstructured text using deep learning methods. In this study, we present a comprehensive review of methods on neural network based relation extraction.

"Deep neural networks shown promise various tasks natural language processing , DNN usually considered black-box model. In recent years, explaining features encoded inside DNN become emerging direction. Based inherent hierarchical structure natural language, many methods use latent tree structures language guide DNN learn interpretable feature representations. However, interpretability usually conflicts discrimination power. There considerable gap pursuing interpretability features pursuing superior performance. Therefore, study, aim explain trained black-box DNN post-hoc manner, explanation DNN affect performance. This essentially different previous studies designing new network architectures losses learn interpretable features, e.g.~physically embedding tree structures DNN. Given trained DNN, paper, propose analyze interactions among input words, used DNN make prediction. Our method generates tree structure objectively reflect interactions among words. Mathematically, interaction several words quantified difference contribution case words contribute jointly prediction case individual word contributes independently prediction. The interaction words may bring either positive negative effects prediction. For example, word green word hand sentence green hand strong positive interaction prediction person's identity, words green hand indicate ``novice"" jointly, rather work individually represent hand green color. The core challenge study guarantee objectiveness explanation. I.e. tree needs reflect true interactions among words without significant bias. The Shapley value widely considered unique unbiased estimation word contribution, satisfies four desirable properties, i.e.~linearity, dummy, symmetry efficiency. Thus, define interaction benefit among words based Shapley value. Let us consider constituent words. denote numerical contributions word prediction DNN, respectively. represents numerical contribution entire constituent prediction. Hence, measures interaction benefit constituent. If , interactions among words positive effects prediction; otherwise, negative effects. Here, computed Shapley values. Given trained DNN input sentence words, Figure shows tree structure reflects word interactions encoded inside DNN. In tree, leaf nodes represent input words. Each non-leaf node corresponds constituent input sentence. A parent node connects two child nodes significant interaction benefits. We use parent node encode interactions among child sub-constituents. More specifically, two types interactions among words, i.e.~ interactions within constituent interactions constituents. {} Interactions within constituent exist among two words constituent. For sentence ``the sun shining sky,"" interactions within constituent sky consist interactions among combinations words, including interactions , , among . {} Interactions constituents. In aforementioned sentence, interactions constituent sun adjacent constituent shining composed potential interactions among combinations words two constituents, including interactions , , , , , , , , . The tree selects encodes salient interactions among words, order reveal signal processing DNN. We propose additional metrics diagnose interactions among words, e.g.~the quantification interactions within constituent, quantification interactions two adjacent constituents, ratios interactions modeled unmodeled tree. Theoretically, method used generic tool analyze various DNNs, including BERT, ELMo, LSTM, CNN Transformer. Experimental results demonstrated effectiveness method. Contributions paper summarized follows. We propose method extract quantify interactions among words. A tree structure automatically generated represent salient interactions encoded DNN. We design six metrics analyze interactions, provides new perspectives understand DNNs. In survey, summarized neural relation extraction methods terms approaches data supervision datasets task. In addition, explained common challenges discussed possible remedies them. To acquire abundant training instances, latest studies make use distant supervision. However, brings noise data greatly affects training relation extraction models. In addition, explicit negative samples, since data wrong annotations due ill-alignment unstructured text knowledge graph. For reason, instead sentence-level approaches supervised relation extraction, multi-instance approaches developed relation extraction distant supervision. Also, few-shot learning relation extraction research area still room improvement. Supervised approaches abandoned. Indeed, incorporating pre-trained language models supervised relation extraction make significant improvements comparison using conventional deep learning methods. Instead treating entity recognition relation extraction separately pipeline approaches, later studies adopt end-to-end approaches jointly extracting entities relations, tend better handle problems associated overlapping triples long-tail relations."," This paper proposes a method to disentangle and quantify interactions among words that are encoded inside a DNN for natural language processing. We construct a tree to encode salient interactions extracted by the DNN. Six metrics are proposed to analyze properties of interactions between constituents in a sentence. The interaction is defined based on Shapley values of words, which are considered as an unbiased estimation of word contributions to the network prediction. Our method is used to quantify word interactions encoded inside the BERT, ELMo, LSTM, CNN, and Transformer networks. Experimental results have provided a new perspective to understand these DNNs, and have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method."

"Simultaneous translation widely used international conferences, summits business. Different standard neural machine translation , simultaneous NMT stricter requirement latency. We cannot wait end source sentence start translation right reading first words. That is, translator required provide instant translation based partial source sentence. Simultaneous NMT formulated prefix-to-prefix problem, prefix refers sub-sequence starting beginning sentence translated. In simultaneous NMT, face uncertainty conventional NMT, since translation starts partial source sentence rather complete information conventional NMT. \Waitk{} simple yet effective strategy simultaneous NMT generated translation words behind source input. That is, rather instant translation word, \waitk{} actually leverages future words. Obviously, larger leverage future information, therefore results better translation quality cost larger latency. Thus, used real-world applications, relatively small simultaneous NMT. While small values allowed inference, observe training larger lead better accuracy \waitk{} inference, demonstrated Figure, wait- model required EnglishGerman translation.

A sentiment analysis included full paper."," Simultaneous neural machine translation  has attracted much attention recently. In contrast to standard NMT, where the NMT system can utilize the full input sentence, simultaneous NMT is formulated as a prefix-to-prefix problem, where the system can only utilize the prefix of the input sentence and more uncertainty is introduced to decoding. \Waitk is a simple yet effective strategy for simultaneous NMT, where the decoder generates the output sequence $k$ words behind the input words. We observed that training simultaneous NMT systems with future information  generally outperforms the standard ones . Based on this observation, we propose a framework that automatically learns how much future information to use in training for simultaneous NMT. We first build a series of tasks where each one is associated with a different $k$, and then learn a model on these tasks guided by a controller. The controller is jointly trained with the translation model through bi-level optimization. We conduct experiments on four datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."

As first contribution paper, conduct comprehensive literature survey different text classification tasks performed review text Section . The recent success deep learning NLP provides solutions text classification tasks promising results. For example, recent NLP model sentiment classification achieves accuracy 97.1\%, 0.7\% away human performance . While exists highly effective models, process developing expensive time-consuming. To make things even worse, model architecture ``globally optimal''. We found literature researchers proposed new model architectures achieve best performance task. This means expensive process model engineering repeated individual application.

The problem of semantic tagging is largely solved with supervised learning and today, deep learning models are widely perceived to be better for semantic tagging. However, there is no comprehensive study supporting the popular belief. Practitioners often have to train different types of models for each semantic tagging task to identify the best model. This process is both expensive and inefficient.  We embark on a systematic study to investigate the following question: Are deep models the best performing model for all semantic tagging tasks? To answer this question, we compare deep models against ``simple models'' over datasets with varying characteristics. Specifically, we select three prevalent deep models  and two simple models , and compare their performance on the semantic tagging task over 21 datasets.  %The results showed that deep models are not %necessarily better than simple models when the %characteristics of datasets are variable. %\xiaolan{Maybe say they did not perform well on large datasets first. The previous sentence claims they are not better, so the next sentence better elaborate over this point.} \xiaolan{Maybe add a transition sentence? e.g., To better understand their performance}  %To understand what are the exact characteristics of datasets affecting tagging quality, we selected the representative simple model  and deep model , and compared their performances on different types of datasets.  Results show that the size, the label ratio, and the label cleanliness of a dataset significantly impact the quality of semantic tagging. Simple models achieve similar tagging quality to deep models on large datasets, but the runtime of simple models is much shorter. Moreover, simple models can achieve better tagging quality than deep models when targeting datasets show worse label cleanliness and/or more severe imbalance. Based on these findings, our study can systematically guide practitioners in selecting the right learning model for their semantic tagging task. %\textcolor{blue}{In particular, we found that simple models outperform deep models on larger datasets with higher label ratios or worse label cleanliness, when runtime is a concern}.  %The conditional outperformance of deep models %suggests that practitioners should carefully %select learning models when they aim to achieve %the best tagging quality.  %Our results will systematically guide practitioners in selecting the right learning model for their semantic tagging task. % %To further assist practitioners to pick right %learning models, we generated a comprehensive heat map that compares tagging qualities across varied combinations of models and datasets. The heat map will be an instructional reference for practitioners to adopt appropriate models and set accurate expectations when tagging sentences for their own datasets.  %\wctan{heat map or table?} \jinfeng{I prefer heat map that uses colors and reflects the effect of data characteristics on F1}  %\textcolor{red}{Our results indicate that practitioners should pay attention to dataset characteristics when they apply deep models for better \tagging{} quality.

We conduct four experiments testing its preference for structural vs. linear generalizations in different structure-dependent phenomena. We find that BERT makes a structural generalization in 3 out of 4 empirical domains---subject-auxiliary inversion, reflexive binding, and verb tense detection in embedded clauses---but makes a linear generalization when tested on NPI licensing. We argue that these results are the strongest evidence so far from artificial learners supporting the proposition that a structural bias can be acquired from raw data. If this conclusion is correct, it is tentative evidence that some linguistic universals can be acquired by learners without innate biases. However, the precise implications for human language acquisition are unclear, as humans learn language from significantly less data than BERT. % learns in a setting vastly different from humans.  % the question remains open whether or not human could plausibly acquire our own structural bias as well, as BERT learns in a setting  % We cannot necessarily conclude that humans could plausibly acquire this bias as well, since BERT learns from far more data than human learners.  % Nonetheless, these results are still valuable in that they suggest that a structural bias may be learnable in principle from raw data alone. If this turns out to be correct, it is a refutation of a key assumption in \cites{chomsky1965aspects} argument that structural bias is innate to humans.

"Geoparsing process recognizing geo-locating location mentions texts. It widely applied various textual data, important task geographic information retrieval \cite[]{purves2018geographic}. A geoparsing system, known geoparser, usually functions two steps: toponym recognition toponym resolution. Toponym recognition detects place mentions texts, toponym resolution resolves place name ambiguity assigns appropriate spatial footprint . Many geoparsers developed, CLAVIN, Edinburgh Geoparser \cite[]{grover2010use}, GeoTxt \cite[]{karimzadeh2019geotxt}, TopoCluster \cite[]{delozier2015gazetteer}.

This competition attracted 29 registered teams 8 teams eventually submitted system run \cite[]{weissenbacher2019semeval}. The winning teams leveraged state-of-the-art neural network based models, BiLSTM-CRF deep contextualized word embeddings, design geoparsers. Particularly, geoparser first place, DM\_NLP \cite[]{wang2019dm_nlp}, achieved 90\% precision, recall, F1 score toponym recognition. This result exciting brings question ``are yet?""

A major limitation SemEval 2019 Task 12 competition submitted geoparsers tested single dataset 45 research articles one particular domain Bio-medicine. Existing research shown geoparser different performances tested different datasets \cite[]{gritta2018s}. Accordingly, answering question whether problem geoparsing considered solved requires systematic evaluation state-of-the-art geoparsers multiple datasets ideally different text genres . In recent work, developed online platform called EUPEG Extensible Unified Platform Evaluating Geoparsers \cite[]{hu2018eupeg,wang2019eupeg}. EUPEG hosts majority geopasing resources reported literature, including eight annotated datasets, nine geoparsers, eight evaluation metrics. In addition, eight annotated datasets four different text genres news articles, Wikipedia articles, social media posts, texts Web pages. The source code EUPEG related geoparsing resources shared GitHub. In paper, systematically evaluate top geoparsers SemEval Task 12 using EUPEG benchmarking platform. We focus top three end-to-end geoparsers showed highest performances competition, DM\_NLP , UniMelb , UArizona . We test performances three geoparsers datasets hosted EUPEG, compare performances existing geoparsers. The contributions paper follows: We revisit two major error trends observed evaluation word character based generation models. First, repetitions tags words generated text body. A sample sentence generated word-based language model - ``The corres Also , I operating gift ensure, extent links "" - demonstrates behavior. While, hypothesized behavior larger text lengths, brittleness model uses characters words units text generation observed shorter text sequence generation well. We believe, nature input system modeled temperature parameter used sample generation play important role behavior predictive model. While RNN model generated text `some' malicious intent - examples shown steps coherent congruous. We designed RNN based text generation system generating targeted attack emails challenging task novel approach best knowledge. The examples generated however suffer random strings grammatical errors. We identify areas improvement deep generation system - reduction repetitive content well inclusion legitimate phishing examples analysis model training. We would also like experiment addition topics tags like `bank account', `paypal', `password renewal', etc. may help generate specific emails. It would interesting see generative RNN handles topic based email generation problem. \section*{Acknowledgements} This research supported part NSF grants CNS 1319212, DGE 1433817, DUE 1241772, DUE 1356705.

A geoparsing system, known as a geoparser, takes some texts as the input and outputs the recognized place mentions and their location coordinates. In June 2019, a geoparsing competition, Toponym Resolution in Scientific Papers, was held as one of the SemEval 2019 tasks. The winning teams developed neural network based geoparsers that achieved outstanding performances . This exciting result brings the question ``are we there yet?'', namely have we achieved high enough performances  to possibly consider the problem of geoparsing as solved? One limitation of this competition is that the developed geoparsers were tested on only one dataset which has 45 research articles collected from the particular domain of Bio-medicine. It is known that the same geoparser can have very different performances  on different  datasets. Thus, this work performs a systematic evaluation of these state-of-the-art geoparsers using our recently developed benchmarking platform EUPEG that has eight annotated datasets, nine baseline geoparsers, and eight performance metrics. The evaluation result suggests that these new geoparsers indeed improve the performances of geoparsing on multiple datasets although some challenges remain."

To empirically validate our model, we use a large-scale Russian EHR dataset consisting of about 4 million unique patient visits. This is the largest such study for the Russian language and one of the largest globally. We performed a number of comparative experiments with other text representation models on the task of multiclass classification for 265 disease subset of ICD-10. The experiments demonstrate improved performance of our models compared to other baselines, including a fine-tuned Russian BERT  variant.

Recent works have been devoted to leveraging text summarization and have achieved promising results.      However, these summarization-based methods did not take full advantage of the summary including ignoring the inherent interactions between the summary and document.     As a result, they limited the representation to express major points in the document, which is highly indicative of the key sentiment.       In this paper, we study how to effectively generate a discriminative representation with explicit subject patterns and sentiment contexts for DSA.      A Hierarchical Interaction Networks  is proposed to explore bidirectional interactions between the summary and document at multiple granularities and learn subject-oriented document representations for sentiment classification.      Furthermore, we design a Sentiment-based Rethinking mechanism  by refining the HIN with sentiment label information      to learn a more sentiment-aware document representation.      We extensively evaluate our proposed models on three public datasets. The experimental results consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed models and show that HIN-SR outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.       \keywords{ Document-level Sentiment Analysis  \and Rethinking Mechanism  \and Document Representation.}"
"Text generation refers wide range tasks involving generating natural language, including limited machine translation, sentence simplification, text summarization. Recent success neural-based text generation relies heavily large parallel dataset training, may available real-world natural language processing applications. In work, consider unsupervised text generation, parallel data available. This setting challenging, significant potential scientific research industrial applications . %Unsupervised text generation assumes parallel data available, still aims accomplishing certain tasks, machine translation, sentence simplification, text summarization. Unsupervised text generation significant potential scientific research industrial applications .

While approaches require parallel corpora, generated sentences highly subject rules, hence lack flexibility natural language. Other work constructs pseudo-parallel data, feasible certain tasks like unsupervised machine translation. Recently, researchers developed search-based techniques unsupervised text generation, heuristically defined scoring function evaluates quality sentence, involving language fluency, semantic compliance, task-specific aspects. Then, algorithm performs word-level edits search towards optimum scoring function. With reasonably designed scoring function, approaches shown effective variety applications like paraphrase generation, sentence summarization, text simplification. However, search-based approach two major drawbacks: 1) The inference efficiency low. To obtain output sentence, search algorithm would perform hundred steps local edits re-evaluations. This could considerably slower autoregressive decoder, generates words sequentially. 2) The search could yield noisy results, since scoring function defined heuristically search conducted locally discrete sentence space.% stochastic word editing. To end, propose new framework unsupervised text generation learning search , contains strong search module explores sentence space, well learning module learns search results. For search module, adopt simulated annealing algorithm. At step, SA proposes local edit neural network, either accepts rejects proposal based heuristically defined scoring function. For learning, employ two methods train conditional generative model, word-level cross-entropy loss sequence-level max-margin loss. Within \model{}, search learning boosted iterative fashion.

Initially introduced for English, such pre-trained word embeddings quickly emerged for a number of other languages. Subsequently, there have been a number of attempts to align the embedding spaces across languages, which could enable a number of cross-language NLP applications. Performing the alignment using unsupervised cross-lingual learning  is especially attractive as it requires little data and often rivals supervised and semi-supervised approaches. Here, we analyze popular methods for UCL and we find that often their objectives are, intrinsically, versions of the Wasserstein-Procrustes problem. Hence, we devise an approach to solve Wasserstein-Procrustes in a direct way, which can be used to refine and to improve popular UCL methods such as iterative closest point , multilingual unsupervised and supervised embeddings  and supervised Procrustes methods. Our evaluation experiments on standard datasets show sizable improvements over these approaches. We believe that our rethinking of the Wasserstein-Procrustes problem could enable further research, thus helping to develop better algorithms for aligning word embeddings across languages.

This is a real-world challenge that an AI system must learn to handle.  Usually we rely on collecting more auxiliary information or developing a more efficient learning algorithm. However, the general gradient-based optimization in high capacity models, if training from scratch,  requires many parameter-updating  steps over a large number of labeled examples to perform well \cite{DBLPSnellSZ17}.    % The general belief is that gradient-based optimization in high capacity classifiers, if training from scratch,  requires many iterative steps over many examples to perform well \cite{DBLPSnellSZ17}. However, due to the availability of large-scaled pretrained model such as BERT, RoBERTa, those classifiers could have relatively good initialization; in this case, fine-tuning on support set is feasible.  If the target task itself cannot provide more information, how about collecting more tasks equipped with rich annotations to help the model learning?  The goal of meta-learning is to train a model on a variety of tasks with rich annotations, such that it can solve a new  task using only a few  labeled samples. The key idea  is to train the model's initial parameters such that the model has maximal performance on a new task after the parameters have been updated through zero or a couple of gradient steps. % The process of training a model闁炽儲鐛 parameters such that a few gradient steps, or even a single gradient step, can produce good results on a new task can be viewed from a feature learning standpoint as building an internal representation that is broadly suitable for many tasks. If the internal representation is suitable to many tasks, simply fine-tuning the parameters slightly  can produce good results % \cite{DBLPFinnAL17}.  There are already some surveys for meta-learning, such as \cite{DBLPVilaltaD02,DBLPabs03548,DBLP05439}. Nevertheless,  this paper focuses on NLP domain, especially few-shot applications. We try to provide  clearer definitions, progress summary and some common datasets  of applying meta-learning to few-shot NLP."

Many current models use word embeddings to identify duplicate questions, but the use of topic models in feature-engineered systems suggests that they can be helpful for this task, too. We therefore propose two ways of merging topics with word embeddings  in a new neural architecture for question paraphrase identification. Our results show that our system outperforms neural baselines on multiple CQA  datasets, while an ablation study highlights the importance of topics and especially early topic-embedding fusion in our architecture."

Subject category information can be used for building faceted search for digital library search engines. This can significantly assist users in narrowing down their search space of relevant documents. Unfortunately, many academic papers do not have such information as part of their metadata. Existing methods for solving this task usually focus on unsupervised learning that often relies on citation networks. However, a complete list of papers citing the current paper may not be readily available. In particular, new papers that have few or no citations cannot be classified using such methods. Here, we propose a deep attentive neural network  that classifies scholarly papers using only their abstracts. The network is trained using 9 million abstracts from Web of Science . We also use the WoS schema that covers 104 subject categories.  %The abstracts are represented by a fix-length vector, which is generated by concatenating retrained top frequency word vectors.  The proposed network consists of two bi-directional recurrent neural networks followed by an attention layer. We compare our model against baselines by varying the architecture and text representation. Our best model achieves micro-${F_1}$ measure of $0.76$ with $F_1$ of individual subject categories ranging from $0.50$--$0.95$. The results showed the importance of retraining word embedding models to maximize the vocabulary overlap and the effectiveness of the attention mechanism. The combination of word vectors with TFIDF outperforms character and sentence level embedding models. We discuss imbalanced samples and overlapping categories and suggest possible strategies for mitigation. We also determine the subject category distribution in CiteSeerX by classifying a random sample of one million academic papers.     \tiny  \keyFont{ \section{Keywords:}text classification, text mining, scientific papers, digital library, neural networks, CiteSeerX, subject category} %All article types: you may provide up to 8 keywords; at least 5 are mandatory."

There 3 ways commonly adopted mitigate data imbalance problem: data resampling, algorithmic adaptations, cost sensitive classification . One commonly used way mitigate problem data resampling. This method based rebalancing SC distributions either deleting instances major SCs supplementing artificially generated instances minor SCs . We always undersample major SCs, means reduce sample sizes SCs 15 , small training robust neural network models. The oversampling strategies SMOTE works problems involving continuous numerical quantities, e.g., \citet{salaheldeen2015predicting}. In case, synthesize vectors ``abstracts'' SMOTE map actual words word representations sparsely distributed large WE space. Even oversample minor SCs using semantically dummy vectors, generating samples take large amount time given high dimensionality abstract vectors high IR. Therefore, use real data. We discuss potential impact classification results contributed categories overlapping training data. Our initial classification schema contains 104 SCs, mutually exclusive. Instead, vocabularies categories overlap others. For example, papers exclusively labeled ``Materials Science"" ``Metallurgy"" exhibit significant overlap tokens. In WE space, semantic vectors labeled either category overlapped making hard differentiate them. Figure shows confusion matrices closely related categories ``Geology"", ``Mineralogy"", ``Geochemistry Geophysics''. Figure t-SNE plot abstracts closely related SCs. To make plot less crowded, randomly select 250 abstracts SC shown Figure. Data points representing ``Geology"", ``Mineralogy"", ``Geochemistry Geophysics"" tend spread overlapped way hard visually distinguished. Since dimension WE high feature vector sparse, use TF-IDF represent abstracts belonging mentioned SCs evade singularity issues. We reduce dimension abstract using t-SNE plot abstracts 2D graph.

Although ``Genetics Heredity'' seems relatively far isolated ``Zoology'', mixed ``Plant Sciences'' ``Biology'' instances, consistent contingency matrix Figure . One way mitigate problem merge overlapped categories. However, special care taken whether overlapped SCs truly strongly related evaluated domain experts. For example, term ``Engineering"" qualifies generic term application technical aspects rather SC. ``Zoology'', ``PlantSciences'', ``Ecology'' merged single SC called ``Biology'' . ``Geology'', ``Mineralogy'', ``GeoChemistry GeoPhysics'' merged single SC called ``Geology''. ``Engineering'' broad category containing numerous branches related various technical aspects. Since ``Engineering'' cannot considered category, removed instances SC dataset. However, However, ``Materials Science'' ``Metallurgy'' may merged single SC. By aforementioned merges, number SCs reduced 74. As preliminary study, classified merged dataset using best model achieved improvement overall micro- score 0.78. The ``Geology'' SC merging significantly improved . The ``Biology'' merging significantly higher compared previous . A thorough study necessary category merges make new schema topic future work.

"As cross-disciplinary study, combine general linguistics computational linguistic approach. Various types word embedding models proposed analyze large size corpora languages . By way illustration, word embeddings combined artificial neural networks reflect one aspect available language processing human mind. Nevertheless, innovative methods face difficulty ``purely data-driven approaches still struggle reach linguistic depth knowledge-driven predecessors. Bridging gap types approaches therefore important future research direction'' \citep[99]{dethlefs_context-sensitive_2014}. Hence, selected linguistically motivated classification words i.e., nominal classification , case study demonstrate knowledge provided linguistic theories concord information encoded basic statistical structures word embeddings. More specifically, selected Swedish since observations regard L1 L2 acquisition nominal classification systems Swedish controversial differ languages. First, monolingual children acquire Swedish grammatical gender nearly errors , considered rare comparison gender languages, ``children's acquisitional paths reported quite error-free"" \citep[214-217]{bohnacker_nominal_2004}. Moreover, gender assignment Swedish nouns via phonological form semantics generally considered unpredictable , makes observation even unexpected. Second, L1 acquisition display lack errors, L2 learners encounter difficulties, suggesting different strategies employed \citep[218]{bohnacker_nominal_2004}. Hence, existing linguistic analysis could provide additional perspectives computational approach help understand elements Swedish problematic terms grammatical gender perception. Moreover, matching performance artificial neural network linguistic observation made humans also represents insightful comparative study, since simulating one facet learning process brain artificial neural networks ``have become subject intense interest scientists spanning broad range disciplines including psychology, physics, mathematics, computer science, biology neurobiology閳 \citep[69]{gopal_neural_1996}. Thus, propose following research questions: 1) Can word embedding model combined artificial neural networks interpret grammatical gender Swedish? 2) What types error made computational model explain errors linguistic perspective? Our experiment relies two main sources data, corpus Swedish raw sentences list nouns affiliated grammatical genders. The raw corpus used train word embedding model. The output model set vectors associated words corpus. The dictionary used filter non-noun words affiliate vector nouns grammatical genders. These word vectors affiliated grammatical genders used train neural network takes word vectors input determine grammatical genders output. The results network analyzed linguistic perspective.

We wish that this paper may serve as one of the bridges to connect the methods of computational linguistics and general linguistics. Taking nominal classification in Swedish as a case study, we first show how the information about grammatical gender in language can be captured by word embedding models and artificial neural networks. Then, we match our results with previous linguistic hypotheses on assignment and usage of grammatical gender in Swedish and analyze the errors made by the computational model from a linguistic perspective."
"Large-scale generative language models received recent attention due high-quality open-ended text generation ability~. Generating texts LMs usually relies form random sampling. Pure sampling often leads incoherent low-quality texts , whereas greedy decoding leads excessive repetitions, another form low quality. The right decoding algorithm needed generate high-quality texts controlled attributes . We introduce mirostat,\footnote{The word mirostat derived mirum Latin surprise stat meaning control.} neural text decoding algorithm actively controls generative process maintain perplexity generated text certain desired value. Mirostat uses adaptive top- sampling algorithm actively tune value helps maintain overall perplexity text; recall top- sampling next word sampled top probable choices. Top- sampling several recent sampling methods motivated suppressing unreliable tail probability distribution trained LMs. Another sampling method top-, also known nucleus sampling, next word chosen top probable choices, smallest integer cumulative probability mass least . While top- sampling involves fixed number probable choices, top- sampling involves dynamic number choices based fixed value shows better statistical human-evaluated performance. For small values , sampling methods unfortunately repeat phrases generated text. This handled penalizing repetitions using appropriate temperature values adding diversity generated text . On hand, large values lead incoherent texts similar pure sampling. Although choosing appropriate values avoid repetition incoherence, involves ad hoc tuning parameters. Even fixed value , generated text varying statistical properties. Intriguingly, demonstrate via Example Appendix, small values certain perplexity statistic generated texts called surprise closely linked repetitions large values surprise linked incoherence. Perplexity statistical metric used evaluate quality neural text generation, closely related average surprise shown Fig. Appendix formalized Sec.. A large-scale human subject experiment showed human-evaluated quality closely related likelihood generated text fixed number tokens. In particular, reducing perplexity increases quality upto point quality starts dropping. This implies good control perplexity generated text would give direct control quality generated text . Generating texts appropriately chosen target perplexity value may maximize quality generated text. Ergo mirostat. \iffalse %%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Unfortunately, existing decoding methods top- top- sampling provide good control average surprise generated text, observed Ex..

Sec. shows theoretically cross-entropy hence perplexity grows top- top- sampling function respectively, previously unknown. Sec. introduces mirostat sampling, outputs texts predetermined target perplexity value. Although perplexity may fully capture quality text~, much literature discusses correlation quality~. Hence, algorithm control perplexity helps generate high-quality text. Sec. experimentally shows much fluctuation cross-entropy rates top- top- sampling function input parameters, hence unable control perplexity output text.

Distorting probability distributions, top-, top-, temperature sampling help improve quality generated texts, parameters properly tuned . Tuning methods, however, ad hoc provide good control statistics output. Our method uses statistics previously-generated tokens input generate next token, distorting probability distribution helps control overall statistics generated text. This ability control perplexity output key advantage method previous work. This, used relation perplexity human-evaluated quality observed , yield text better quality control. \paragraph{Controllable text generation} Controllable text generation oft focused semantics output text, LMs like CTRL , sampling algorithms like plug-and-play LM constrained sentence generation Metropolis-Hastings . Contrarily approach purely statistical, guiding decoder along desired statistical path addresses issues pure sampling greedy decoding. %A new model 1.63 billion parameters, CTRL, trained generate text based control word. %On hand, sampling algorithms like Plug Play Language Model Constrained sentence Generation Metropolis-Hastings work inference stage top pretrained language model control certain attributes generated text. %PPLM shows using attribute classifiers top pretrained language models helps control text generation . %CGMH uses Metropolis-Hastings sampling generate text certain constraints like appearance multiple keywords %%%%%%%%% : SeqGAN \paragraph{Quality-diversity tradeoff} %Distorting probability distributions decoding using Top-, top-, low-temperature sampling improve quality text, cost reduced diversity. Applications like question-answering demand high-quality generation, open-ended tasks story generation demand diversity too. propose variants beam search induce diversity generated text. However, observe tradeoff quality diversity; observe diversity closely related entropy whereas quality maximized certain range observed likelihood values fixed-length sentences. Our algorithm well-controls observed cross-entropy, observed likelihood per token generated text. Hence, maintaining observed cross-entropy certain range, ensure high-quality text generation. \paragraph{Repetitions} Greedy decoding LMs often lead texts excessive repetitions token- sentence-levels. Several techniques proposed address this. Token loss dynamic reweighting hypothesizes tokens difficult learn others reweighting tokens learning balance things reduce repetitions~. use repetition penalty decoding reduce repetition tokens. suggest cause repetitions flaw training objective use new objective gives less probability unlikely sequence including texts high repetitions. Variants top- sampling repetition penalty used reduce repetitions. Here, demonstrate near-linear relation repetitions observed cross-entropy directly control repetitions controlling observed cross-entropy. Our main contributions follows: approach computational linguistics, demonstrated linear word embedding model combined neural network capable capturing information grammatical gender Swedish accuracy . From linguistic approach, run error analysis regard errors generated neural network. The results show artificial neural network encounters difficulties cases polysemy, i.e., linguistic form may link different referents belong different part speech categories. Such phenomenon explained linguistic theories gender assignment, neuter nouns generally mass nouns, undergo conversion different part speech categories . Thus, additional tuning computational model direction expected improve performance. We wish paper may serve bridge connect field linguistics field computational linguistics currently divergent approaches toward linguistic data. By way illustration, show word embedding neural network applied answer research questions linguistic nature. Furthermore, linguistic analysis targeting errors model equivalently beneficial enhance computational model. Our study limited terms broadness. Although data rich, word embedding combined neural network represents relatively simple model, solely shows informative pure context information. A human carrying linguistic task activation kind linguistic context, also syntax, semantics, morphological associations, among others. Thus, testing required compare contribution different factors regard gender classification. Furthermore, applied one type word embedding model along one type neural network classifier. It would necessary investigate accuracy different combinations, verify type model provides precision regard task grammatical gender assignment. Finally, study involved one language, i.e., Swedish, unbalanced distribution gender among lexicon. Thus, future research equivalently aims including phylogenetically weighted sample languages scrutinize word embedding neural network reach level accuracy cross-linguistically."," Neural text decoding algorithms strongly influence the quality of texts generated using language models, but popular algorithms like top-$k$, top-$p$ , and temperature-based sampling may yield texts that have objectionable repetition or incoherence.  Although these methods generate high-quality text after ad hoc parameter tuning that depends on the language model and the length of generated text, not much is known about the control they provide over the statistics of the output.  This is important, however, since recent reports show that humans prefer when perplexity is neither too much nor too little and since we experimentally show that cross-entropy  has a near-linear relation with repetition. First we provide a theoretical analysis of perplexity in top-$k$, top-$p$, and temperature sampling, under Zipfian statistics. Then, we use this analysis to design a feedback-based adaptive top-$k$ text decoding algorithm called mirostat that generates text  with a predetermined target value of perplexity without any tuning. Experiments show that for low values of $k$ and $p$, perplexity drops significantly with generated text length and leads to excessive repetitions . Contrarily, for large values of $k$ and $p$, perplexity increases with generated text length and leads to incoherence . Mirostat avoids both traps. Specifically, we show that setting target perplexity value beyond a threshold yields negligible sentence-level repetitions. Experiments with human raters for fluency, coherence, and quality further verify our findings."
"\pheadNoSpace{Background} Text classification become fundamental building block modern information systems, increasing need able classify texts wide range languages. However, organizations target increasing number markets, challenging collect new task-specific training data new language supported. To overcome this, cross-lingual systems rely training data source language train model applied entirely different target languages , alleviating training bottleneck issues low-resource languages. Traditional cross-lingual text classification approaches often relied translation dictionaries, lexical knowledge graphs, parallel corpora find connections words phrases different languages . Recently, based deep neural approaches BERT , important advances learning joint multilingual representations self-supervised objectives . These enabled substantial progress cross-lingual training, mapping textual inputs different languages common vector representation space . With models Multilingual BERT , obtained vector representations English Thai language documents, instance, similar discuss similar matters. Still, recent empirical studies show representations bridge differences different languages. While possible invoke multilingual encoders train model English training data apply documents language Thai, model may work well applied Thai document representations, since latter likely diverge English representation distribution subtle ways. In work, propose semi-supervised adversarial perturbation framework encourages model robust towards divergence better adapt target language. Adversarial training method learn resist small adversarial perturbations added input maximize loss incurred neural networks . % Nevertheless, gains observed adversarial training previous work limited, merely invoked form monolingual regularization. Our results show adversarial training particularly fruitful cross-lingual framework also exploits unlabeled data via self-learning. \pheadWithSpace{Overview Contributions} Our model begins learning available source language samples, drawing multilingual encoder added adversarial perturbation. Without loss generality, following, assume English source language. After training English, subsequently, use model make predictions unlabeled non-English samples part samples high confidence prediction scores repurposed serve labeled examples next iteration adversarial training model converges. The adversarial perturbation improves robustness generalization regularizing model. At time, adversarial training makes tiny perturbations barely affect prediction result, perturbations words self-learning viewed inducing form code-switching, replaces original source language words potential nearby non-English word representations. Based combination adversarial training semi-supervised self-learning techniques, model evolves become robust regard differences languages. We demonstrate superiority framework Multilingual Document Classification comparison state-of-the-art baselines. Our study proceeds show method outperforms methods cross-lingual dialogue intent classification English Spanish Thai . This shows semi-supervised adversarial framework effective previous approaches cross-lingual transfer domain-specific tasks, based mix labeled unlabeled data via adversarial training multilingual representations. We provided theoretical explanation perplexity varies function input parameters popular top- top- neural text decoding algorithms, showing log perplexity varies nearly linearly function highly nonlinearly function . Building analysis, developed mirostat, neural text decoding algorithm directly controls perplexity generated text wide range text length. therefore several advantages. sampling algorithms. While top- top- provide good control statistics output, mirostat maintain perplexity generated text wide range text length. Notably, longer texts certain ranges input parameters, top- top- sampling fall boredom confusion traps cause low-quality texts; Mirostat avoids traps. Further, recent large-scale human evaluation neural generated text suggests human-judged text quality maximized certain range perplexity output: mirostat provides direct control stay perplexity range. There also implications data compression given Appendix. As takeaway, find mirostat target surprise around , produces varying lengths high-quality texts minimal repetitions. This corroborated experiments human raters. We analyze relation perplexity repetitions text: fixed model, repetitions vary linearly perplexity independent sampling method. We also find larger LMs less repetitions fixed perplexity. Future work would include theoretical analysis repetitions, boredom confusion traps, convergence properties mirostat."," In cross-lingual text classification, one seeks to exploit labeled data from one language to train a text classification model that can then be applied to a completely different language. Recent multilingual representation models have made it much easier to achieve this. Still, there may still be subtle differences between languages that are neglected when doing so. To address this, we present a semi-supervised adversarial training process that minimizes the maximal loss for label-preserving input perturbations. The resulting model then serves as a teacher to induce labels for unlabeled target language samples that can be used during further adversarial training, allowing us to gradually adapt our model to the target language. Compared with a number of strong baselines, we observe significant gains in effectiveness on document and intent classification for a diverse set of languages."

I think so, maybe remove. If handle fine keep cites.} Within scope grammar induction, two main directions research: unsupervised constituency parsing, attempts discover underlying structure phrases, unsupervised dependency parsing, attempts discover underlying relations words. Early work induction syntactic structure focused learning phrase structure generally used variant probabilistic context-free grammars . In recent years, dependency grammars gained favor alternative syntactic formulation . Specifically, dependency model valence forms basis many modern approaches dependency induction. Most recent models grammar induction, PCFGs, DMVs, formulations, generally coupled models variety neural model use embeddings capture word similarities, improve flexibility model parameterization, . Notably, two different syntactic formalisms capture different views syntax. Phrase structure takes advantage abstracted recursive view language, dependency structure concretely focuses propensity particular words sentence relate each-other syntactically. However, attempts unsupervised grammar induction made marry two let benefit other. This precisely issue attempt tackle paper. As specific formalism allows us model formalisms once, turn lexicalized probabilistic context-free grammars . L-PCFGs borrow underlying machinery PCFGs expand grammar allowing rules include information lexical heads phrase, example shown \Cref{fig:lexicalized-phrase-structure-tree}.

This contrasts to the most popular current methods for grammar induction, which focus on discovering either constituents or dependencies. Previous approaches to marry these two disparate syntactic formalisms  have been plagued by sparsity, making them unsuitable for unsupervised grammar induction.  However, in this work, we present novel neural models of lexicalized PCFGs which allow us to overcome sparsity problems and effectively induce both constituents and dependencies within a single model. Experiments demonstrate that this unified framework results in stronger results on both representations than achieved when modeling either formalism alone.\footnote{Code is available at \url{https://github.com/neulab/neural-lpcfg}.}  %\gn{Abstract is pretty dry. First maybe introduce unsupervised parsing, then explain that there are alternative formalisms: dependency and constituency, handeled by DMV and CFG respectively. Then explain that lexicalized PCFG was used in supervised parsing, but has  not been applied to unsupervised parsing, which we posit is due to sparsity. then introduce our method.} %Y% Unsupervised grammar induction aims at inducing probabilistic grammar rules from natural language corpora. Within the scope of grammar induction there are two main directions of research: unsupervised constituency parsing and unsupervised dependency parsing, on which directions dependency models with valence  and probabilistic context-free grammars  are two most successful models respectively. Lexicalized PCFGs provide a method to unify these two kinds of models, but were mostly used in supervised parsing, and its performance is largely restricted by the data-sparsity problem. In this paper, we propose neural lexicalized probabilistic context-free grammars  for jointly performing both unsupervised dependency and constituency parsing. Our Neural L-PCFGs are parameterized by several simple neural networks which score production rules by conditioning on the lexical head of the parent constituent. Key to the success of our approach is that the neural parameterization enables efficient parameter sharing, thereby alleviating the data-sparsity issues common to lexicalized PCFGs. %includes a set of Chomsky Normal Form  productions rules and their scores parameterized by neural networks. The scores of productions rules are conditioned on the head word of the parent constituent, which makes our model sensitive to lexical information; meanwhile, neural parameterization enables parameter sharing mechanism, thus alleviating the sparse-data problem.  %Y% Unlike prior work that pits constituencies and dependencies against each other, our novel formulation produces a single model which simultaneously achieves strong performance across both syntactic formulations. Experiments show that our model could achieve better results comparing to models designed specific for these two tasks. %The compound latent variable makes the L-PCFG more general. In experiments on unsupervised consitituency parsing and dependency parsing tasks, our model compete favorably against specialized models for those two tasks."

Be sure to highlight how the work %   contributes to our understanding of machine learning and healthcare. Clinical studies often require understanding elements of a patient闁炽儲鐛 narrative that exist only in free text clinical notes. To transform notes into structured data for downstream use, these elements are commonly extracted and normalized to medical vocabularies. In this work, we audit the performance of and indicate areas of improvement for state-of-the-art systems. We find that high task accuracies for clinical entity normalization systems on the 2019 n2c2 Shared Task are misleading, and underlying performance is still brittle. Normalization accuracy is high for common concepts , but much lower for concepts unseen in training data . We demonstrate that current approaches are hindered in part by inconsistencies in medical vocabularies, limitations of existing labeling schemas, and narrow evaluation techniques. We reformulate the annotation framework for clinical entity extraction to factor in these issues to allow for robust end-to-end system benchmarking. We evaluate concordance of annotations from our new framework between two annotators and achieve a Jaccard similarity of 0.73 for entity recognition and an agreement of 0.83 for entity normalization. We propose a path forward to address the demonstrated need for the creation of a reference standard to spur method development in entity recognition and normalization."

Yet the end-to-end learned dense retrieval  often underperforms word-based sparse retrieval.

"In traditional web search, given query, documents retrieved large candidate corpus based relevance score usually term based metrics BM25. Recently, fast rapid progress neural text embedding deep contextualized word representations ELMo BERT , researchers begin focus applying deep neural network models generate document query embedding latent space separately based raw features retrieve documents according vector similarities. These methods improve semantic understanding besides term match achieve better retrieve quality. However, industrial environment, due complexity natural language diversity user query expressions, web search retrieval needs input information better document/query understanding term matching, promotion deep model architecture, especially long tail queries appear times never before. However, almost existing deep models IR take information document raw text input. They may provide better query-document semantic understanding due progress model, can't provide additional information matching. Besides, ~\citet{guo2016deep} claim Information Retrieval tasks different Nature Language Process tasks, important focus exact matching former learning text embeddings latter. These inspires us involve information besides query documents better match semantic understanding modeling. Typically industrial search engine, document information could come several sources anchor, url, title click,etc. Among click stream proved one important features directly indicates user feedbacks. Thus provides us feasibility get potential information specific document understanding similar documents co-click relationship, e.g. two documents clicked query history indicates similarity respects. Using co-click information deep search model trivial. Because much noise, inconsistent need accurate information term semantic matching. The noise co-click relations mainly lies following aspects: % \para{i)False clicks:}user false clicks may connect irrelevant queries documents. \para{ii)Multi-intentions:}one document may contain many aspects users may interest specific part them. As result users may click document different search intentions. E.g. one document whose text ""amazing mens gothic t-shirts black rose"" may clicked users interested two different intentions: ""Gothic T-shirt"" ""Black rose T-shirt"". Thus, information introduced historical click may become noise document searched query belonging another intention. As result, co-click documents involved click ""gothic t-shirts"" would noise query ""black rose t-shirts"". This kind multi-intention noise could ignored traditional term match methods nature, hurt semantic deep encoding model proper handled. \para{iii)Semantic Difference:}even two single-intention documents click, might differences semantics. E.g. two documents themes ""How high Mount Everest"" ""How many countries climbed Everest"" may click ""Mount Everest"". But encoding one document, completely introducing text information one cause vector erroneously shifting semantic space, need feature extraction noise eliminating. In paper, focus web-scale web search problem industrial environment aim enriching document text co-click relations improve retrieve quality. We first build web-scale co-click graph based real click log extract neighbours document complementary information. Then propose siamese deep model MIRA based Bert graph neural networks two-factor mechanism encode queries documents neighbours continuous vectors. Our key challenge lies two aspects: i)how effectively extract information co-click graph billions nodes eliminating noises. ii) scale training online serving graph neural based embedding. To handle co-click noise problem, firstly split clicks document different intention groups based term Jaccard Similarity build Multi-Intention Co-Click Graph, document represented several nodes node contains clicks belonging one intention. As result, one node could reached intention clicks thus avoiding cross-intention information. Secondly, propose use graph attention networks two-factor attention mechanism help precisely extract neighbour information eliminating false click semantic difference noise. Specifically, design interaction attention factor measuring vectors semantic correlation another dot product factor measuring vectors term match correlation. As scalability challenge, instead using query-document bipartite graph, involve document nodes graph modeling, alleviates need expensive real-time query neighbours search online. Furthermore, instead using transductive training need multiplying feature matrices powers full graph Laplacian, use inductive training method GCN, sample neighbour nodes document neighbour subgraph, thus dramatically reducing training inference cost. %split clicks document different groups based token jaccard similarity. Then instead using one node represent document co-click graph, uses multi nodes We demonstrate effectiveness efficiency proposed framework one public web search dataset collocted SouGou one private web-scale click data set collected real search engine Bing.

Our studies empirically validate theory ANCE negatives much bigger gradient norms, reduce stochastic gradient variance, improve training convergence.","  We study the problem of deep recall model in industrial web search, which is, given a user query, retrieve hundreds of most relevance documents from billions of candidates. The common framework is to train two encoding models  based on neural embedding which learn the distributed representations of queries and documents separately and match them in the latent semantic space. However, all the exiting encoding models only leverage the information of the document itself, which is often not sufficient in practice when  matching with query terms, especially for the hard tail queries. Meanwhile, It has been proved that the click-through logs over query-document pairs in real search engine provide rich information for multiple tasks in information retrieval. Inspired by this, we aim to leverage the additional information for each document from its co-click neighbours to help document retrieval. The challenges include how to effectively extract  information and eliminate noise when involving co-click  information in deep model while meet the demands of billion-scale data size for real time online inference.  To handle the  noise in co-click relations, we firstly propose a web-scale Multi-Intention Co-click document Graph which builds the co-click connections between documents on click intention level but not on document level, and it is scalable to billions of document nodes based real search engine logs. Then we present an encoding framework based on Bert and Graph Attention Networks  which leverages a two-factor attention mechanism to aggregate neighbours and  can effectively handle the large amount of noise in the co-click relations. To meet the online latency requirements, we only involve neighbour information in document side whose vectors could be pre-built offline, and keep the query encoding only depends on its own text, which can save  the time-consuming  query neighbor search in real time serving. We conduct extensive offline experiments on both public dataset and private web-scale dataset from two major commercial search engines demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method compared with several baselines. And a further case study reveals that co-click relations mainly help improve web search quality from two aspects: key concept enhancing and query term complementary.  %categorizing and grouping the clicks of each document into different intentions when building the graph, and the two-factor attention mechanisms in the graph neural network, our proposed method can effectively handle the large amount of noise in the co-click graph. By restricting the co-click information only to the document side, we can avoid the expensive graph neighbor search time for online serving. We conduct offline experiments on both public dataset and private web-scale dataset from a major commercial search engine demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method compared with several baselines. And a online A/B test in production environment further shows our proposed model improve search engine revenue."
"In real world, complex systems always related multiple types objects relations. Such systems could effectively abstracted via heterogeneous information networks , different types nodes connected unique edges . Hence, compared homogeneous networks possess single type nodes, HINs provide richer tool model real-life issues. In order mine abundant information behind HIN, network representation learning, also known network embedding learning, embeds network low-dimensional space, drawn lots interests researchers. Classical network embedding models like DeepWalk, LINE node2vec devised homogeneous network using random walks capture structural information networks. However, methods lacking capability expressing HIN. Hence, models designed specifically HINs proposed. They basically based metapath, sequence node types edge types between. To leverage relationship nodes metapaths, different mechanisms proposed, example, heterogeneous SkipGram, proximity distance Hardmard function. Nevertheless, heterogeneous models' performances confront bottleneck due limited ability metapath capturing features HIN. Recently, graph neural networks investigated thoroughly, showing promising results modeling structural information network. GNNs usually empowered complex encoders, basically deep neural networks like CNN, could explore neighborhood structure instead path, thus improving performance representing HIN. However, train deep model HIN often time-consuming requires train whole model every specific task, leading inefficiency. To address issue, inspired recent advance pre-training framework, propose pre-train model large datasets first place. And specific downstream task specific dataset like DBLP, use fine-tuning technique minimal task-specific parameters, improve model efficiency effectiveness. The two-stage framework exploring features HIN named \mtv paper. In specific, pre-training stage, inspired BERT, adopt deep bi-directional transformers train dataset. Thus need transform node's neighborhood sequence. We first measure rankings nodes HIN based degree betweenness centrality. Then use ranking-based BFS strategy generate sequence, is, always selecting closest high-ranking nodes form sequence. Afterwards prepare input representation trained, combination token, segment, type, ranking position embeddings. Note paper, use type embeddings indicate type information node. During pre-training stage, adopt two strategies reduce parameters improve model efficiency, i.e., factorized embedding parameterization cross-layer parameter sharing. We design two tasks pre-train \mtv. One masked node modeling task, similar masked language modeling mode. In task, certain percentage nodes masked need predict masked nodes. The adjacent node prediction task could capture relationship nodes. Given node sequence , aim predict whether node sequence adjacent node. Notice operation applies deep bi-directional transformers node sequence actually variant GNN aggregating method, transformer layers could regarded deep neural networks. We would verify bi-directional transformer layers outperform traditional deep neural networks like CNN, LSTM attention mechanism ablation analysis. During fine-tuning stage, choose four benchmark downstream tasks, i.e, link prediction, similarity search, node classification node clustering. In link prediction similarity search, use node sequence pairs input, identifying whether link two nodes measuring similarity two nodes, respectively.

Recently, graph neural networks  have drawn a lot of attention which are very expressive for mining a HIN, while they suffer from low efficiency issue. In this paper, we propose a pre-training and fine-tuning framework \mtv to capture the features of a HIN. Unlike traditional GNNs that have to train the whole model for each downstream task, \mtv only needs to fine-tune the model using the pre-trained parameters and minimal extra task-specific parameters, thus improving the model efficiency and effectiveness. Specifically, in pre-training phase, we first use a ranking-based BFS strategy to form the input node sequence. Then inspired by BERT, we adopt deep bi-directional transformer encoders to train the model, which is a variant of GNN aggregator that is more powerful than traditional deep neural networks like CNN and LSTM. The model is pre-trained based on two tasks, i.e., masked node modeling  and adjacent node prediction . Additionally, we leverage factorized embedding parameterization and cross-layer parameter sharing to reduce the parameters. In fine-tuning stage, we choose four benchmark downstream tasks, i.e., link prediction, similarity search, node classification and node clustering. We use node sequence pairs as input for link prediction and similarity search, and a single node sequence as input for node classification and clustering.  The experimental results of the above tasks on four real-world datasets verify the advancement of \mtv, as it outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives consistently and significantly."

The ability of generating detailed and non-repetitive responses is crucial for the agent to achieve human-like conversation. In this paper, we propose a novel generative decoding architecture to generate high-quality responses, which moves away from decoding the whole encoded semantics towards the design that advocates both transparency and flexibility. In this architecture, word generation is decomposed into a series of attention-based information selection steps, performed by the novel recurrent Deliberation, Abandon and Memory  module. Each DAM module performs an adaptive combination of the response-level semantics captured from the encoder and the word-level semantics specifically selected for generating each word. Therefore, the responses contain more detailed and non-repetitive descriptions while maintaining the semantic accuracy. Furthermore, DAM is flexible to cooperate with existing visual dialogue encoders and adaptive to the encoder structures by constraining the information selection mode in DAM. We apply DAM to three typical encoders and verify the performance on the VisDial v1.0 dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed models achieve new state-of-the-art performance with high-quality responses. The code is available at https://github.com/JXZe/DAM."

This idea loosely resembles human long-term memory might achieve retrieval well contextual knowledge used semantic encoding . Our experiments confirm value approach. In paper, classes correspond object labels, environments correspond combinations contextual labels given either object labels image caption keywords. Representations individual inputs, call `instance representations', form 2D matrix rows corresponding classes columns corresponding environments, element indication much instance resembles corresponding class versus environment. The parameters environment defined start uniformly selecting randomly chosen number labels power set available contextual labels. The class representation, refer `template', form template vector. It contains average distance estimates distribution class distributions respective environments. By computing cosine similarity instance representation templates, class membership determined efficiently .

A template representation refers to the generic representation that captures the characteristics of an entire class. The proposed technique uses end-to-end deep learning to learn structured and composable representations from input images and discrete labels. The obtained representations are based on distance estimates between the distributions given by the class label and those given by contextual information, which are modeled as environments. We prove that the representations have a clear structure allowing to decompose the representation into factors that represent classes and environments. We evaluate our novel technique on classification and retrieval tasks involving different modalities .  \keywords{Composable representations \and Deep learning \and Multimodal.}"

We selective memorisation process; finer details text quickly forgotten retain relatively compact representation book's details. Early models natural language used recurrent neural networks Long Short-Term Memory emulated selective memory approach modelling past compact state vector. The model learns store relevant information within state implicitly order optimise task loss. The LSTM reigned state-of-the-art language model two decades since inception '90s arguably ubiquitous neural sequence model. Unlike human memory systems, however, LSTM struggles reason long-range contexts reading text. This observed multiple contexts. In carefully curated LAMBADA benchmark tests language model predictions sections book text long term structure decided human raters, LSTMs completely fail. Namely LSTMs guess correct word time, humans considered accuracy. For regular language modelling, \citet{daniluk2017frustratingly} observed LSTM augmented attention would rarely attend beyond seven preceding words context. Samples LSTMs language models quickly devolve generic text devoid overall theme. This lead many wonder whether non-negligible long-range signal task language modelling. Recently seen deep attention models draw long-range signal text, even objective simple next-word prediction. With advent Transformer , significant gains language modelling performance obtained extending models' attention thousands words.

If found unnecessary reduce state's memory considerably. In paper investigate simple question: use short-range attention majority layers Transformer recover performance? The hypothesis possible, many steps reasoning involve short-range correlations, i.e. piece characters together form words phrases. We find indeed possible. We recover comparable performance long-range language modelling using small fraction long-range memories baseline TransformerXL. Crucially, find matters long-range memories placed network. Placing lower layers network ineffective; placing latter layers interleaved across network works much better. We show model trains less time memory, due reduction expensive attention operations.

For language modelling in particular, the Transformer-XL --- a Transformer augmented with a long-range memory of past activations --- has been shown to be state-of-the-art across a variety of well-studied benchmarks. The Transformer-XL incorporates a long-range memory at every layer of the network, which renders its state to be thousands of times larger than RNN predecessors. However it is unclear whether this is necessary. We perform a set of interventions to show that comparable performance can be obtained with 6X fewer long range memories and better performance can be obtained by limiting the range of attention in lower layers of the network."

Even better feature representations attention mechanisms, sequential structure models tends lead %over-simplified generic descriptions lack specificity. %, \exempli ``a piece fruit'' instead ``a red apple,'' ``a group people'' instead ``three people.'' %For example, models tend generate sentence ``a group people'' instead ``three people.''

Inspired by the idea of the compositional neural module networks in the visual question answering task, we introduce a hierarchical framework for image captioning that explores both compositionality and sequentiality of natural language. Our algorithm learns to compose a detail-rich sentence by selectively attending to different modules corresponding to unique aspects of each object detected in an input image  to include specific descriptions such as counts and color. In a set of experiments on the MSCOCO dataset, the proposed model outperforms a state-of-the art model across multiple evaluation metrics, more importantly, presenting visually interpretable results. Furthermore, the breakdown of subcategories $f$-scores of the SPICE metric and human evaluation on Amazon Mechanical Turk  show that our compositional module networks effectively generate  accurate and detailed captions."

However, one of the serious problems that has emerged with this increase, is the propagation of rumors.  Therefore, rumor identification is a very critical task with significant implications to economy, democracy as well as public health and safety.  We tackle the problem of automated  detection of rumors in social media  in this paper by designing a modular  explainable architecture that uses both latent  and handcrafted features and can be expanded to as many new classes of features as desired.  This approach will allow the end user to not only determine whether the piece of information on the social media is real of a rumor, but also give explanations on why the algorithm arrived at its conclusion. Using attention mechanisms, we are able to interpret the relative importance of each of these features as well as the relative importance of the feature classes themselves.  The advantage of this approach is that the architecture is expandable  to more handcrafted features as they  become available and also to conduct extensive testing to determine the relative influences of theses features in the final decision. Extensive experimentation on popular  datasets and  benchmarking against eleven  contemporary algorithms, show that  our approach performs significantly better in  terms of F-score and accuracy  while also being interpretable."
"In many circumstances, difference completed suicide suicide attempt slightly greater pressure applied trigger. In either case importance gaining greater understanding psychological conditions surrounding tragic event immediately apparent; leads individual contemplate, perhaps commit, act? Similarly, sorts thoughts feelings one encounter experiencing suicidal ideation? And might understanding phenomena aid improving prevention efforts? Although challenging questions, suicide notes represent one potential window psychology individuals complete suicide. By analyzing language contents suicide notes, gain unique insight shared features individual experiences perhaps greater understanding cognitive processes accompany suicidal ideation. Previous research suicide notes highlighted specific properties notes attempt better understand characteristics stand differentiate types texts. Some work focused studying contents suicide notes , including dominant emotional themes , key motives . In general, studies focused answering question: suicide note? That is, contents consistently observe comparing notes people committed suicide? For example, Al-Mosaiwi Johnstone recently found vocabulary used individuals risk suicide different suffered mental disorders related depression anxiety. Individuals experienced suicidal ideation tended utilize different vocabularies mainly absolutist words, indicating suicide notes emotional lexical footprints. Sentiment analysis applied goal comparing emotional contents suicide notes categorized learning algorithms versus trained clinicians, well whether algorithms reliably distinguish genuine simulated suicide notes. These automated text-analysis techniques offer powerful advantages standard, qualitative approaches commonly applied study suicide notes clinical psychologists. For one, quantitative methods -- used sentiment analysis emotional profiling -- allow use objective criteria clearer operationalizations psychological constructs . Qualitative methods, hand, depend upon human judges code interpret texts, compare ratings assess consistency conclusions. Thus, may high degree uncertainty limited reliability techniques used make inferences. Moreover, automatic approaches text analysis allow researchers evaluate millions lines text short amounts time. On hand, complex statistical/machine learning models often produce results difficult understand thus may helpful tasks different prediction explanation. In present work apply network science methods analysis genuine suicide notes. Importantly, show network modeling used expand text-analytic toolbox psychology provide novel ways answering complex research questions text data . In contrast automated approaches text analysis, network models allow researchers encode only, e.g., word sentiment, also broader set connections word surrounding text.

THIS IS THE WORKING VERSION OF THIS FILE"," Understanding how people who commit suicide perceive their cognitive states and emotions represents a crucially open scientific challenge. We build upon cognitive network science, psycholinguistics and semantic frame theory to introduce a network representation of suicidal ideation as expressed in multiple suicide notes. By reconstructing the knowledge structure of such notes, we reveal interconnections between the semantic ideas and emotional states of people who committed suicide through structural balance theory, semantic prominence and emotional profiling. Our results indicate that connections between positively- and negatively-valenced terms give rise to a degree of structural balance that is significantly higher than in a null model where the affective structure is randomized and in a linguistic baseline model capturing mind-wandering in absence of suicidal ideation. We show that suicide notes are affectively compartmentalized such that positive concepts tend to cluster together and dominate the overall network structure. Notably, this positive clustering diverges from perceptions of self, which are found to be dominated by negative, sad conceptual associates in analyses about subject-verb-object structure and emotional profiling. A key positive concept is ``love'', which integrates information relating the self to others in ways that are semantically prominent across suicide notes. The emotions populating the semantic frame of ``love'' combine joy and trust with anticipation and sadness, which can be linked to psychological theories of meaning-making as well as narrative psychology. Our results open new ways for understanding the structure of genuine suicide notes and may be used to inform future research on suicide prevention."
"% {\let\thefootnote\relax}% In recent years, machine learning research community devoted substantial energy scaling neural networks enormous sizes. Parameter-counts frequently measured billions rather millions , time financial outlay necessary train models growing concert . These trends especially pronounced natural language processing , massive BERT models---built Transformer architecture pre-trained self-supervised fashion---have become standard starting point variety downstream tasks . Self-supervised pre-training also growing popularity computer vision , suggesting may become standard practice across deep learning past . In parallel race ever-larger models, emerging subfield explored prospect training smaller subnetworks place full models without sacrificing performance . For example, work lottery ticket hypothesis demonstrated small-scale networks computer vision contain sparse, matching subnetworks capable training isolation initialization full accuracy. In words, could trained smaller networks start known subnetworks choose. Within growing body work lottery ticket hypothesis, two key themes emerged: Initialization via pre-training. In larger-scale settings computer vision natural language processing , lottery ticket methodology find matching subnetworks early point training rather random initialization. Prior point, subnetworks perform better selected pruning randomly. The phase training prior point seen dense pre-training creates initialization amenable sparsification. This pre-training even occur using self-supervised task rather supervised downstream task . Transfer learning. Finding matching subnetworks lottery ticket methodology expensive. It entails training unpruned network completion, pruning unnecessary weights, rewinding unpruned weights back values earlier point training . It costlier simply training full network, and, best results, must repeated many times iteratively. However, resulting subnetworks transfer related tasks . This property makes possible justify investment reusing subnetwork many different downstream tasks. These two themes---initialization via pre-training transfer learning---are also signature attributes BERT models: extraordinary cost pre-training amortized transferring range downstream tasks. As such, BERT models particularly interesting setting studying existence nature trainable, transferable subnetworks. If treat pre-trained weights initialization, matching subnetworks downstream task? Do transfer downstream tasks? Are universal subnetworks transfer many tasks degradation performance? Practically speaking, would allow us replace pre-trained BERT smaller subnetwork retaining capabilities make popular NLP work. Although lottery ticket hypothesis evaluated context NLP transformers , remains poorly understood context pre-trained BERT models.% \footnote{A concurrent study Prasanna et al. also examines lottery ticket hypothesis BERTs. However, important differences questions consider results. See Section full comparison.} To address gap literature, investigate transformer architecture initialization resulting lengthy BERT pre-training regime behave comparison existing lottery ticket results. We devote particular attention transfer behavior subnetworks search universal subnetworks reduce cost fine-tuning downstream tasks going forward. In course study, make following findings: We conclude lottery ticket observations computer vision NLP settings extend BERT models pre-trained initialization. In fact, biggest caveat prior work---that, larger-scale settings, matching subnetworks found early training---disappears. Moreover, indeed universal subnetworks could replace full BERT model without inhibiting transfer. As pre-training becomes increasingly central NLP areas deep learning , results demonstrate lottery ticket observations---and tantalizing possibility train smaller networks beginning---hold exemplar class learning algorithms. This first-of-its-kind study uses cognitive network science identifying key concepts typical suicide notes reconstructing meaning emotions final words expressed authors committed suicide. Structural balance potential mechanism long theorized drive certain aspects cognitive organization, particularly regard resolving conflicting beliefs attitudes. Pairing psychological theories, narrative psychology meaning-maintenance model, consider patterns observed suicide notes fit broader understanding psychological literature. According meaning-maintenance model, people fundamentally driven construe lives, perceptions, behaviors meaningful. This position long held existentialist philosophers, widely accepted contemporary psychologists. Moreover, given drive make meaning experiences perceptions world, people motivated restore sense meaningfulness whenever perceptions life's meaning threatened. Suicidal ideation might represent response threat, also poses challenge identifying meaning one's life. In perspective, writing suicide note may represent way re-establishing sense meaningfulness coherence face circumstances led individual consider complete suicide. This drive find meaningfulness narratives, notes, letters supported narrative psychology, focuses function, structure, contents stories tell others life. With meaning-making distal motive writing suicide notes, may interpret structural balance positive emotional perceptions reported concrete signals meaning-making, rather proximal communicative mechanisms meaning-making readily achieved. In short, argue that: People driven perceive lives meaningful coherent, use narratives story-telling way encapsulate restore perceptions threatened, potential ways improving coherence one's psychological narratives introducing balance positive emotional semantic frames otherwise unbalanced negative sets cognitions. The relevance reasoning results present study summarized two key elements. On one hand, extension structural balance networks valenced conceptual associations provides quantitative evidence content suicide notes tends feature positive triads valence-reshuffled null models. This indicates syntax valence words used suicide notes convey tendency avoid conflicting cognitions assembling together pleasant concepts, line previous qualitative studies quantitative investigations using ``bag-of-words'' approach. On hand, semantic framing emotional profiling denoted suicide notes rich positive/trustful perceptions revolving around concepts ``love'', ``take'', ``go'' ``way''. These positive emotional portrayals also contained strong signals sadness anticipation future. Notice despite overall prominence positive, compartmentalized conceptual structures mindset suicide notes, analysis also found self-perception mostly dominated negative associations. The semantic frame subject-verb-object associates ``I'' highlighted negative semantic relationships self others, mostly dominated sadness absent linguistic baseline model provided free associations . This represents compelling evidence cognitive dissonance mindset people committed suicide. Suicide notes denote high level structural balance positive conceptual triads also negative cluster associates surrounding self lacking triadic closure . Our results integrate extend previous findings also show ``love'' central concept suicide notes. Recent studies debated whether emotional perception ``love'' suicide notes positive common language. Our network approach enriched linguistic annotations identified ``love'' suicide notes attributed positive connotations appear common language, also imbued sense sadness. Furthermore, love central across suicide notes, described mostly related towards people diverse ways, function purely positive emotion . This indicates importance going beyond considering words isolation better understand suicide notes. Our quantitative approach reconstructs words interconnected language suicide notes compares random network models linguistic baseline models . This network structure reveals ``love'' as: prominent considered narratives, even mind-wandering captured free associations, focused relations others eliciting nuanced set emotions consisting joy trust also nuances anticipation sadness. Structuring narratives around trustful joyous relationships loved ones aligns well interpretation suicide notes strategically driven meaning identification. Another outcome strategy, aimed avoiding conflicting cognitions, might signals anticipation sadness attributed ``love'', identify resignation, passive acceptance threats generates anger conflict cost feeling defeated incapable creating change. This perception calls future research investigating psychological mechanisms work. All all, reconstructed contexts concepts suicide notes provide evidence meaning-making narratives, aimed coping threats meaning identification conflict-avoidant storytelling. This rich landscape invisible considering words isolation emerges complex structure conceptual emotional connections words text. Cognitive network science, combining psycholinguistics, computer science network science, represents powerful framework reconstructing conceptual relationships, opening window people's minds, along subjective perceptions perspectives. The ability cognitive network analyses parse large volumes texts without human supervision calls future large-scale investigations cognitions perceptions expressed suicide notes. This study use machine learning automatic classification texts. It rather focuses reconstruction general mindset embedded suicide notes representing trains thoughts produced people committed suicide. Achieving quantitative knowledge key better understanding suicide notes also empowering interpretable future models automatic language processing. The main limitation present study lack comparison different set texts. One might consider comparing suicide notes corpora, e.g. love letters. However, comparisons would include potential issues unexpected content found text, overall topic corpus offers little guarantee linguistic content semantic frames. For instance, even love letters might frame ``love'' way nuanced sadness, mainly lovestruck authors ideas related regret desire, aspects found also suicide letters. This emotional/semantic overlap leads corpus comparisons including considerable errors make difficult control adopted methods interpret results. We still managed compare suicide notes linguistic baseline model adopting free associations, come mind-wandering devoid suicidal ideation construction. Concerning structural balance cognitive networks, major limitation inability observing triads, creates weak bias towards balanced triangles. This minor issue able observe even constraint, depending null model, different levels balance observed. Moreover, null models subject limitation, still appropriate comparisons within context. A potential extension analysis could based investigation define neutral links words. Another limitation identification emotional profiles suicide notes based cognitive datasets referring everyday language usage. This problem partially addressed reconstructing emotional profiles specific syntactic relationships detected suicide notes. In way, attention given emotions individual words rather way words interconnected within observed texts.

Our approach combines unique advantages automated text analysis networks, using theoretical tools psychology , gain detailed understanding underlying psychological states associated suicide notes. Cognitive network methods allow us move beyond comparatively opaque, ``black-box'' models classifying suicide notes, extract key ideas emotions embedded text. This knowledge extraction allows researchers address questions higher-level psychological processes test hypotheses based theory. Although present study data-driven therefore exploratory, demonstrates cognitive networks valid approach future confirmatory investigations, leading greater understanding new possibilities suicide prevention. \section{Materials Methods} A genuine suicide note text left person subsequently committed suicide. This investigation used Genuine Suicide Notes corpus Schoene Dethlefs. The corpus represents collection 139 genuine suicide notes collected fact-checked newspaper articles previous small-scale investigations suicide notes. All notes English anonymized changing names people places reference identifying information. Shorter suicide notes, including less two sentences, discarded. This work implemented two types network construction. Co-occurrence networks captured syntactic relationships adjacent words sentence. Subject-verb-object networks captured triplets syntactic relationships subject, verb object. These network representations structure knowledge suicide nodes also enriched sentiment labels emotional labels . Additional details found in~SI:~and. Sentiment labels positive, negative neutral used structural balance analysis. Let undirected signed network, vertices edges . We define edge labels two words follows: words neutral; either negative; positive one positive neutral. As result, obtain signed network 1962 positive links, 1362 negative links 5696 neutral links. We consider neutral links play role calculating degree balance. The resulting network contains 2151 triangles. With definition shadowed triad Figure never observed signed network. The degree balanced obtained calculating fraction balanced triads. Since define edges based signs nodes, combination positive, negative neutral words leading it. In manuscript build investigate cognitive networks conceptual associations representing authors conceptually framed perceived ideas last letters. These network structures compared baseline network null models also linguistic baseline models, indicating people non-suicidal populations would framed interconnected set concepts occurring suicide notes. Whereas investigations based machine learning adopted textual corpora like love letters blog posts depression linguistic baseline models, clear type content semantic frames expected given text corpus. For instance, love letters might present feelings melancholia closely related suicidal ideation, without clear direct control experimenter. This uncertainty makes comparison difficult. For reason, followed another approach, using texts directly complex networks baseline linguistic models. We focused mind-wandering, cognitive phenomenon concepts interconnected ways relying memory free additional constraints . Mind-wandering captured free associations, i.e. naming first words coming mind thinking certain concept. Hence, use networks free associations baseline linguistic models representative mind-wandering large population individuals without suicidal tendencies. Using Small World Words dataset, built network free associations. It contains 1581 concepts, included original co-occurrence network, connected according free/mind-wandering associations. These associative structure used main text linguistic baseline investigating semantic frames emotional perceptions found suicide notes. \section*{Acknowledgements} The authors acknowledge Winter Workshop Complex Systems series, Cynthia S.

Edge weights equal number co-occurrences two words SVO triplets. Note way decomposing SVO triplets node pairs introduce structural bias, component appears exactly two times three pairs generated single triplet. On hand, tokens playing central syntactic roles appear SVO triplets less central ones. Therefore, tokens higher degrees strengths SVO network. This important property method encodes crucial semantic features text corpora directly degree/node strength distributions. In order filter errors relationships words accidental and/or idiosyncratic individual suicide notes, SVO network limited relations weights equal greater . In words, relationships occurred least twice entire corpus considered. Then, positive weights decreased remove truncation lower tail order make sampling appropriate canonical ensemble feasible. The linguistic networks also enriched with: Both sentiment emotional datasets relative overall, global perceptions concepts represented mainstream populations. Hence, datasets directly informative subjective emotional perceptions portrayed people committed suicide. In order reconstruct subjective perceptions, network measures required. The CO SVO networks enable reconstruction semantic frame terms network neighborhood given concept. As example, semantic frame ``love'' represented first neighbors concepts syntactically related ``love'' people committed suicide suicide notes. Checking semantic frame/network neighborhood provides crucial information contexts perspectives featured ``love'' suicide notes. On emotional level, sentiment emotional attributes universal, could change according subjective perceptions authors context concepts appear. For instance, ``love'' usually indicated positive word bringing emotions trust joy. But associations like ``betraying love'' ``missing love''? Placing ``love'' different contexts alter subjective perception. This main reason language cannot simply considered bag words, i.e. collection isolated concepts, rather network interconnected linguistic units whose meaning emotions change according way networked together. Therefore networks provide access associative emotional perceptions conceptual entities minds people committing suicide. \section{Additional natural language processing} Words notes lemmatized annotated part-of-speech dependency tags classified state-of-the-art NLP library Spacy\footnote{https://spacy.io} based OntoNotes annotated corpus Penn Treebank. The tags specify roles played particular words sentence well syntactic dependency relationships them. This additional information used derive network representations notes capturing fundamental syntactic links instead simpler, sequential relationships preceding subsequent words. Specifically, allowed decomposition sentences kind generalized subject-verb-object triplets. Here, SVO triplet consists subject, seen active agent, verb seen action performed subject, object standing anything action performed subject relates to. This decomposition used somewhat general, token nominal subject subordinate verb syntactic tree sentence considered object. For instance, approach following sentence decomposed four different SVO triplets: As example shows, method disaggregates relative clauses ``tree, tall'' separate SVO triplets. This way capable capturing semantics compound complex sentences. Moreover, important meaning making tokens appear multiple triplets design. Because this, even simple summaries frequencies words SVO triplets capture important semantic features text corpora. The second important processing step custom lemmatization accounted specific way suicide notes anonymized. Most words lemmatized according standard rules implemented English language Spacy. However, names persons notes substituted several generic placeholder names, Jane William, reduced special ``s/he'' lemma. Moreover, occurrences ``he'' ``she'' also lemmatized way. \subsubsection*{Extracting SVO triplets} The general procedure used extracting SVO triplets relatively straightforward. First, documents tokenized sentences sentences tokenized words. A word considered semantic noun, pronoun, verb, adverb, adjective, adposition negation modifier . Then, semantic words assigned one following classes: Additionally, define two procedures. Finally, SVO triplets extracted sentence according following procedure: For instance, example sentence ``He looking tree, tall'' four \texttt{OBJECT} words mapped four SVO triplets: \section{Structural balance theory} Structural balance theory, first explored Heider, states signed triad balanced product signs must positive. Thus, four possible triads -- , , , -- first third considered balanced. As example, think following statements ``a friend friend friend'', ``an enemy enemy friend'', along similar others, able verify follow concept balance defined Heider. Some years later, Cartwright Harary generalized concept structural balance social networks, introducing signed graphs edges positive negative signs corresponding positive negative ties individuals. They extended concept balanced triads balanced networks allowing cycles three edges. A cycle considered balanced product signs edges positive, i.e., odd number negative edges cycle. To measure structural balance, Harary introduced concept Degree Balance signed network ratio number positive cycles total number cycles . Let signed graph, number cycles , number positive cycles , degree balance . Then: In work use cycles size three -- triads. Even though theories developed half century ago, last decade structural balance theory revivified different domains. Recently, Chiang et.al presented study exploring triadic balance brain regarding brain activity expresses possible cognitive balances people faced cooperative decisions regarding social dilemmas. They showed individual's psychological states reflected different areas brain activated situated unbalanced balanced triads. When encountering unbalanced triads, individuals showed activation brain regions associated cognitive dissonance, reinforcing Heider's theory. \section{Semantic network distance word prominence} The identification semantically related concepts traditionally performed semantic latent analysis, maps problem measuring conceptual distance selecting appropriate metrics vectorial space words. However, predicting semantic relatedness, semantic latent analysis recently outperformed network distance cognitive networks, i.e. counting smallest number conceptual links connecting two concepts connected component given network. We build upon evidence define conceptual relatedness concepts shorter network distance. A concept related to, i.e. shorter network distance from, almost concepts must prominent. This intuitive definition conceptual prominence methodologically implemented closeness centrality, identifies concepts shorter network distance connected concepts. Closeness centrality successfully used previous investigations proxy conceptual prominence predicting word acquisition . Also current analysis, use closeness centrality quantitative way identifying prominent concepts reconstructed mindset around suicidal ideation. As statistical baseline, closeness centrality concepts empirical networks matched closeness centrality configuration models, i.e. random networks fixing empirical degrees words otherwise randomizing conceptual links. SI~Table reports prominent concepts, based closeness centrality, original network co-occurrences baseline free association network . As additional check, words ranked also subgraph co-occurrence network featuring words present free association network. Co-occurrences suicide notes reflect structural organisation knowledge love central topics, pattern observed baseline free association dataset, features ""time"" ""money"" concepts higher closeness connected words. Even performing node alignment co-occurrence free associations networks, i.e. considering subgraph co-occurrences words present free association network, ""love"" remains central concepts. These results indicate ""love"" organisation knowledge assembled authors suicide notes central expected knowledge mindwandering represented free associations. \section{Network degeneracy} Degeneracy network measures tendency random walker starting random node one step ends limited set central nodes. Let normalized weighted undirected adjacency matrix weights row sum interpreted probability distributions next position random walker starting node . Then, degeneracy graph represented defined normalized difference maximal observed entropy probability distribution averaged nodes assuming equally likely: vector column means , , Shannon entropy. The term undirected star graph nodes, is: \section{Emotional Profiling} Emotional profiling performed labeling words according emotion elicit, indicated NRC emotion lexicon. The dataset included 8 basic emotional states, whose combination give rise wide variety nuanced emotion. Emotional profiling performed previous studies, considering number words eliciting given emotion certain network region, e.g. network neighborhood certain concept. The emotional profile word considered counting fraction words syntactically linked eliciting emotion . By definition ranges 0 1 . As reference model, used random sampling words fixing empirical sample size, e.g. number words syntactically linked , neglecting empirical syntactic associations. Counting fraction randomly sampled words eliciting emotion provided direct-sampling distributions random emotional profiles. We used random distributions order attribute z-score observed emotional profile . This statistical procedure, significance level fixed , enabled comparison strength emotions elicited individual concepts considered networks. On one hand, visualization z-scores facilitates immediate understanding stronger emotional intensities elicited given concept. On hand, comparison provides additional information rich concept associations eliciting given emotion."," In natural language processing , enormous pre-trained models like BERT have become the standard starting point for training on a range of downstream tasks, and similar trends are emerging in other areas of deep learning. In parallel, work on the lottery ticket hypothesis has shown that models for NLP and computer vision contain smaller matching subnetworks capable of training in isolation to full accuracy and transferring to other tasks. In this work, we combine these observations to assess whether such trainable, transferrable subnetworks exist in pre-trained BERT models. For a range of downstream tasks, we indeed find matching subnetworks at 40\% to 90\% sparsity. We find these subnetworks at  initialization, a deviation from prior NLP research where they emerge only after some amount of training. Subnetworks found on the masked language modeling task  transfer universally; those found on other tasks transfer in a limited fashion if at all. As large-scale pre-training becomes an increasingly central paradigm in deep learning, our results demonstrate that the main lottery ticket observations remain relevant in this context.

Thus, far efficient select large batch examples time label using crowd-sourced collection process . Traditional batch-active learning often uses ranking functions intractable deep sequence sequence learning , making active learning video description challenging problem, tractable solutions deep neural networks.

Our key contributions are: We presented several neural networks NER MCLs. The key aspects model MCL utilize different embeddings layer, namely, i) root embedding, ii) entity tag embedding iii) tensor layer. The effects aspects investigated individually. The use root embedding leads significant result MCLs' NER. The two also gives positive effects. For Kazakh, proposed NNs outperform CRF-based NER system state-of-the-art including character-based biLSTM-CRF model. The comparisons showed character embedding vital MCL's NER. The experimental results indicate proposed NNs potentially applied morphologically complex languages."," Automatic video captioning aims to train models to generate text descriptions for all segments in a video, however, the most effective approaches require large amounts of manual annotation which is slow and expensive. Active learning is a promising way to efficiently build a training set for video captioning tasks while reducing the need to manually label uninformative examples. In this work we both explore various active learning approaches for automatic video captioning and show that a cluster-regularized ensemble strategy provides the best active learning approach to efficiently gather training sets for video captioning. We evaluate our approaches on the MSR-VTT and LSMDC datasets using both transformer and LSTM based captioning models and show that our novel strategy can achieve high performance while using up to 60\% fewer training data than the strong state of the art baselines. \keywords{Active Learning, Video Captioning}"

However, it still under-performs other methods on unsupervised evaluation benchmarks. Here, we introduce WavAugment, a time-domain data augmentation library and find that applying augmentation in the past is generally more efficient and yields better performances than other methods. We find that a combination of pitch modification, additive noise and reverberation substantially increase the performance of CPC , beating the reference Libri-light results with 600 times less data.

"Recent developments fields electronics, computations data processing led increased interest smart assistants speech interfaces.

In particular, we extend it with an encoder of pretrained speech recognition systems in order to construct end-to-end spoken language understanding systems. Our proposed method is based on the teacher-student framework across speech and text modalities that aligns the acoustic and the semantic latent spaces. Experimental results in three benchmarks show that our system reaches the performance comparable to the pipeline architecture without using any training data and outperforms it after fine-tuning with ten examples per class on two out of three benchmarks."
"Self-supervised learning representations large unlabeled datasets popular contemporary trend machine learning. After widely adopted areas like natural language processing computer vision, self-supervision rapidly developing noteworthy topic audio speech processing. Self-supervision aims capture informative properties underlying structure unlabeled data learn generalized representations. This extremely promising problem settings involving large amount unlabeled data limited labeled data. In context audio speech processing, relevant low resource languages, emotion recognition, cross-cultural speech recognition problems small-sized datasets.

We train a raw audio encoder by combining audio-only self-supervision  with visual self-supervision . The visual pretext task drives the audio representations to capture information related to lip movements. This enriches the audio encoder with visual information and the encoder can be used for evaluation without the visual modality. Our method attains competitive performance with respect to existing self-supervised audio features on established isolated word classification benchmarks, and significantly outperforms other methods at learning from fewer labels. Notably, our method also outperforms fully supervised training, thus providing a strong initialization for speech related tasks. Our results demonstrate the potential of multimodal self-supervision in audiovisual speech for learning good audio representations."

DeepSinger has several advantages over previous SVS systems: 1) to the best of our knowledge, it is the first SVS system that directly mines training data from music websites, 2) the lyrics-to-singing alignment model further avoids any human efforts for alignment labeling and greatly reduces labeling cost, 3) the singing model based on a feed-forward Transformer is simple and efficient, by removing the complicated acoustic feature modeling in parametric synthesis and leveraging a reference encoder to capture the timbre of a singer from noisy singing data, and 4) it can synthesize singing voices in multiple languages and multiple singers. We evaluate DeepSinger on our mined singing dataset that consists of about 92 hours data from 89 singers on three languages . The results demonstrate that with the singing data purely mined from the Web, DeepSinger can synthesize high-quality singing voices in terms of both pitch accuracy and voice naturalness\footnote{Our audio samples are shown in \url{https://speechresearch.github.io/deepsinger/}.}."

Their high complexity, however, makes them very difficult to apply in the first  pass of an online system. Recent studies showed that a considerable part of the knowledge of neural network Language Models  can be transferred to traditional n-grams by using neural text generation based data augmentation. In our paper, we pre-train a GPT-2 Transformer LM on a general text corpus and fine-tune it on our Hungarian conversational call center ASR task. We show that although data augmentation with Transformer-generated text works well for isolating languages, it causes a vocabulary explosion in a morphologically rich language. Therefore, we propose a new method called subword-based neural text augmentation, where we retokenize the generated text into statistically derived subwords. We compare Morfessor and BPE statistical subword tokenizers and show that both methods can significantly improve the WER while greatly reducing vocabulary size and memory requirements. Finally, we also demonstrate that subword-based neural text augmentation outperforms the word-based approach not only in terms of overall WER but also in recognition of OOV words."

"Subjective listening studies reliable form speech quality assessment many applications, including speech enhancement audio source separation. Listeners often rate perceptual quality testing materials using categorical multi-stimuli rating protocols. The test materials often artificially created additively convolutionally mixing clean speech noise reverberation prescribed levels, simulate real environments. Unfortunately, simulated data capture intricate details real environments , clear assessments consistent assessment results real-world environments. Many investigations conclude realistic datasets scenarios needed improve real-world speech processing performance. However, cost time-consuming nature subjective studies also hinders progress. Computational objective measures enable low cost efficient speech quality assessment, many intrusive, non-intrusive, data-driven approaches developed. Intrusive measures, perceptual evaluation speech quality , signal-to-distortion ratio perceptual objective listening quality analysis , generate quality scores calculating dissimilarities clean reference speech signal degraded counterpart . These measures, however, always correlate well subjective quality results. Several non-intrusive objective quality measures developed, including ITU-T standard P.563, ANSI standard ANIQUE+, speech reverberation modulation energy ratio . These approaches use signal processing concepts generate quality-assessment scores. These approaches, however, rely signal properties assumptions always realized real-world environments, hence assessment scores always consistent human ratings. More recent work uses data-driven methods estimate speech quality. The authors combine hand-crafted feature extraction tree-based regression model predict objective PESQ scores. Quality-Net provides frame-level quality assessment predicting utterance-level PESQ scores copied per-frame labels using bidirectional long short-term memory network.

Additionally, a large dataset of real-world signals with listener quality ratings does not currently exist, which would help facilitate real-world assessment. In this paper, we collect and predict the perceptual quality of real-world speech signals that are evaluated by human listeners. We first collect a large quality rating dataset by conducting crowdsourced listening studies on two real-world corpora.

We claim that the use of sentiment analysis will allow decision making models to consider expert evaluations in natural language.

The individual evaluations are aggregated via \new{the procedure \segrev{named }}%a criteria weighting through the attention of the experts.} %We evaluate the methodology in a restaurant decision problem, hence we build the TripR-2020 dataset of restaurant reviews, which we manually annotate and release. \segrev{We evaluate the methodology in a case study of restaurant choice using TripAdvisor reviews, hence we build, manually annotate, and release the TripR-2020 dataset of restaurant reviews.} We \nuevo{analyze the SA-MpMcDM methodology in different scenarios using and not using natural language and numerical evaluations.

Traditionally, experts are allowed to provide numerical ratings or pre-defined linguistic terms to assess the alternatives. Unfortunately, these constraints of current MEMCDM models cause the solutions obtained to be biased, not correct, or even do not correspond to what the experts themselves would expect. Hence, we propose a MEMCDM model that allow experts to express their evaluations without restrictions, i.e., providing evaluations in natural language evaluating undefined criteria and even providing numerical ratings evaluating predefined criteria. This model extracts the expert knowledge from the natural language reviews by means of a sentiment analysis step carrying out an aspect-based sentiment analysis task by means of a multi-task neural network.

The last decade has seen a surge of research in this area due to the unprecedented success of deep learning.  Numerous methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics have been proposed in the literature, raising the need for a comprehensive and updated survey.  This paper fills the gap by reviewing the state of the art approaches from 1961 to 2020, focusing on models from shallow to deep learning.  We create a taxonomy for text classification according to the text involved and the models used for feature extraction and classification. We then discuss each of these categories in detail, dealing with both the technical developments and benchmark datasets that support tests of predictions.  A comprehensive comparison between different techniques, as well as identifying the pros and cons of various evaluation metrics are also provided in this survey.  Finally, we conclude by summarizing key implications, future research directions, and the challenges facing the research area."

In this work, we propose a novel model, the Self-determined Graph Convolutional Network , which determines a weighted graph using a self-attention mechanism, rather using any linguistic tool. Then, the self-determined graph is encoded using a GCN. We test our model on the TACRED dataset and achieve the state-of-the-art result.

To generate comprehensive set keyphrases summarizes key points conveyed target document, reading full document content necessary. However, best knowledge, none previous neural methods provisioned read full content document thousands words long .

Hence, existing neural methods truncate target document; take first hundred words input ignore rest document may contain salient information. To address aforementioned challenges, paper, propose SEG-Net two major components, sentence-selector selects salient sentences document extractor-generator predicts present keyphrases generates absent keyphrases jointly. The primary motivation design sentence-selector decompose long target document small segments, e.g., sentences, paragraphs, identify salient ones keyphrase generation. % One potential solution decompose target document small segments, e.g., sentences, paragraphs, identify salient ones keyphrase generation.

In recent years, deep neural sequence-to-sequence framework has demonstrated promising results in keyphrase generation. However, processing long documents using such deep neural networks requires high computational resources. To reduce the computational cost, the documents are typically truncated before given as inputs. As a result, the models may miss essential points conveyed in a document. Moreover, most of the existing methods are either extractive  or generative , and hence they do not benefit from the advantages of both modeling techniques. To address these challenges, we propose SEG-Net, a neural keyphrase generation model that is composed of two major components,  a selector that selects the salient sentences in a document, and  an extractor-generator that jointly extracts and generates keyphrases from the selected sentences. SEG-Net uses a self-attentive architecture, known as, Transformer as the building block with a couple of uniqueness. First, SEG-Net incorporates a novel layer-wise coverage attention to summarize most of the points discussed in the target document. Second, it uses an informed copy attention mechanism to encourage focusing on different segments of the document during keyphrase extraction and generation. Besides, SEG-Net jointly learns keyphrase generation and their part-of-speech tag prediction, where the later provides syntactic supervision to the former. The experimental results on seven keyphrase generation benchmarks from scientific and web documents demonstrate that SEG-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art neural generative methods by a large margin in both domains.  %Combining these two prevailing approaches in jointly learning to extract and generate can enable us to predict a comprehensive set of keyphrases.  % Relying on only one type of these prevailing approaches risks to miss important keyphrases.  % SEG-Net uses a self-attentive architecture, known as, Transformer to learn document representations for its ability to capture long-range dependencies.  % SEG-Net has a couple of uniqueness compared to the vanilla Transformer.  % during keyphrase generation to emphasize less on the document segments, from where the keyphrases are extracted. % such that the extracted and generated keyphrases remain mutually exclusive."

A typical RFP bid consists RFP advertisement, RFP itself, model contract, proposals/responses bidding entities scoring sheets submissions. RFPs supporting documents publicly available information. MCOs typically utilise historical submissions understand requirements respond better improve chances winning bid. Every RFP response typically runs several hundred pages spread across different websites data stores. Manual exploration historical bids time consuming iterative process. Given changing healthcare landscape, limited time-frame resources draft new responses, current process comprehensive enough extract insights derive competitive advantage. Challenges: Apart industry specific problem statement, work also poses unique challenge scoring entire documents. Most relevant efforts towards automatic scoring dealt short answers essays . Our work deals much larger sequence lengths, larger feature space capture. Another difference relevant literature RFPs written experts multiple iterations, opposed students writing essays evaluation. As such, removes need check superficial grammatical errors. Instead, need identify aspects text enhance scores diminish . Our Solution: In paper, propose automated framework using interpretable natural language processing techniques analyse RFP responses. The framework comprises two components: Text Processing Module Interpretable Scoring Model. RFP responses usually follow standard template/formatting available Portable Document Format PDF short. Moreover, understand content extract insights, text needs extracted granular level . These issues complicate text extraction process thus need develop Text Processing Module. We developed generic Text processing module would extract text different formats response. The extracted text analysed using Interpretable Scoring Model. The scoring model enables us identify terms/phrases auxiliary features impact section/question score positively negatively. We term positively impacting features enablers negatively impacting ones disablers. The framework also provides insights auxiliary features latently impact overall scoring. The framework also provides single portal/platform access historical bid responses similar details across bidders states. % Major Contribution work follows, have: We developed tested computational linguistic model assessment different resources manifesting formal informal learning media {as part learning opportunities Utilization-of-learning-opportunities models } means threshold concepts.

RFP responses are very detailed documents  submitted by competing organisations to win contracts. Subject matter expertise and domain knowledge play an important role in preparing RFP responses along with analysis of historical submissions. Automated analysis of these responses through Natural Language Processing   systems can reduce time and effort needed to explore historical responses, and assisting in writing better responses.  Our work draws parallels between scoring RFPs and essay scoring models, while highlighting new challenges and the need for interpretability. Typical scoring models focus on word level impacts to grade essays and other short write-ups. We propose a novel Bi-LSTM based regression model, and provide deeper insight into phrases which latently impact scoring of responses. We contend the merits of our proposed methodology using extensive quantitative experiments. We also qualitatively asses the impact of important phrases using human evaluators. Finally, we introduce a novel problem statement that can be used to further improve the state of the art in NLP based automatic scoring systems."
"Language model pre-training shown great power improving many natural language processing tasks. Most pre-training models, despite variety, follow BERT architecture heavily relying multi-head self-attention learn comprehensive representations. It found 1) though self-attention module BERT highly non-local operator, large proportion attention heads indeed learn local dependencies due inherent property natural language; 2) removing attention heads fine-tuning downstream tasks degrade performance. The two findings indicate heavy computation redundancy exists current model design. In work, aim resolve intrinsic redundancy issue improve BERT w.r.t. efficiency downstream task performance. We consider question: reduce redundancy attention heads using naturally local operation replace them? We notice convolution successful extracting local features , thus propose use convolution layers efficient complement self-attention addressing local dependencies natural language. Specifically, propose integrate convolution self-attention form \nameofattention{} mechanism combines advantages two operations. Self-attention uses input tokens generate attention weights capturing global dependencies, expect perform local ``self-attention'', i.e., taking local span current token generate ``attention weights'' span capture local dependencies. To achieve this, rather deploying standard convolution fixed parameters shared input tokens, dynamic convolution good choice offers higher flexibility capturing local dependencies different tokens. As shown Fig.b, dynamic convolution uses kernel generator produce different kernels different input tokens. However, dynamic convolution cannot differentiate tokens within different context generate kernels . We thus develop \nameofconv{}, novel convolution produces adaptive convolution kernels receiving input span instead single token, enables discrimination generated kernels tokens within different context. For example, shown Fig.c, proposed \nameofconv{} produces different kernels different ``can'' tokens. With \nameofconv{}, build \nameofattention{} improve conventional self-attention, brings higher efficiency pre-training well better performance capturing global local information. To enhance performance efficiency, also add following new architecture design BERT. First, bottleneck structure designed reduce number attention heads embedding input tokens lower-dimensional space self-attention. This also relieves redundancy lies attention heads improves efficiency. Second, feed-forward module BERT consists two fully connected linear layers activation between, dimensionality inner-layer set much higher input output, promises good performance brings large parameter number computation. Thus devise grouped linear operator feed-forward module, reduces parameters without hurting representation power. Combining novelties together makes proposed model, termed ConvBERT, small efficient. Our contributions summarized follows. 1) We propose new \nameofattention{} replace self-attention modules BERT, leverages advantages convolution better capture local dependency. To best knowledge, first explore convolution enhancing BERT efficiency. 2) We introduce novel \nameofconv{} operation utilize multiple input tokens dynamically generate convolution kernel. 3) Based proposed \nameofconv{ }\nameofattention{}, build ConvBERT model. On GLUE benchmark, ConvBERTbase achieves 86.4 GLUE score 5.5 higher BERTbase 0.7 higher ELECTRAbase requiring less training cost parameters. 4) ConvBERT also incorporates new model designs including bottleneck attention grouped linear operator independent interest NLP model development. \documentclass{article} % need pass options natbib, use, e.g.: \PassOptionsToPackage{numbers, compress}{natbib} % loading neurips_2020 % ready submission % \usepackage{neurips_2020} % compile preprint version, e.g., submission arXiv, add add % [preprint] option: % \usepackage[preprint]{neurips_2020} % compile camera-ready version, add [final] option, e.g.: \usepackage[final]{neurips_2020} % avoid loading natbib package, add option nonatbib: % \usepackage[nonatbib]{neurips_2020} \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} % allow utf-8 input \usepackage[T1]{fontenc} % use 8-bit T1 fonts \usepackage{hyperref} % hyperlinks \usepackage{url} % simple URL typesetting \usepackage{booktabs} % professional-quality tables \usepackage{amsfonts} % blackboard math symbols \usepackage{nicefrac} % compact symbols 1/2, etc. \usepackage{xcolor} \usepackage{microtype} % microtypography \usepackage{xspace} \usepackage{subcaption} \usepackage{graphicx} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{floatrow} \floatsetup[table]{capposition=top} \usepackage{float} \usepackage{wrapfig} \usepackage{comment} \usepackage{caption} \definecolor{mypink}{RGB}{251,228, 234} \newcommand\bertbase{BERT\xspace} \newcommand\bertlarge{BERT\xspace} \newcommand{\nameofconv}{span-based dynamic convolution} \newcommand{\nameofattention}{mixed attention} \newcommand*\samethanks[1][\value{footnote}]{\footnotemark[#1]} \title{ConvBERT: Improving BERT Span-based Dynamic Convolution} % The \author macro works number authors.

Future work includes building multimodal system model aesthetic well content wise qualities proposal documents."," Pre-trained language models like BERT and its variants have recently achieved impressive performance in various natural language understanding tasks. However, BERT heavily relies on the global self-attention block and thus suffers large memory footprint and computation cost. Although all its attention heads query on the whole input sequence for generating the attention map  from a global perspective, we observe some heads only need to learn local dependencies, which means the existence of computation redundancy. We therefore propose a novel span-based dynamic convolution to replace these self-attention heads to directly model local dependencies. The novel convolution heads, together with the rest self-attention heads, form a new mixed attention block that is more efficient at both global and local context learning. We equip BERT with this mixed attention design and build a ConvBERT model. Experiments have shown that ConvBERT significantly outperforms BERT and its variants in various downstream tasks, with lower training costs and fewer model parameters. Remarkably, ConvBERTbase model achieves 86.4 GLUE score, 0.7 higher than ELECTRAbase, using less than $1/4$ training cost. \footnote{Code and pre-trained model will be released at \url{https://github.com/yitu-opensource/ConvBert}.}"
"One defining characteristics human languages productive. % We combine together concepts novel ways express ideas never thought before. % This good reason: children, observe little world must speak others, meaning even mundane language novel parroting back something already expressed us. % Similarly, even massive data collection efforts, deep models opportunity observe small subset possible utterances worlds. % This problem becomes especially acute models must drive behavior robot, misunderstanding command may pose serious safety hazard.

Recent work has   shown that while deep networks can mimic some human language abilities when   presented with novel sentences, systematic variation uncovers the limitations   in the language-understanding abilities of neural networks. We demonstrate that these   limitations can be overcome by addressing the generalization challenges in a   recently-released dataset, gSCAN, which explicitly measures how well a robotic   agent is able to interpret novel ideas grounded in vision, e.g., novel   pairings of adjectives and nouns. The key principle we employ is   compositionality: that the compositional structure of networks should reflect   the compositional structure of the problem domain they address, while allowing   all other parameters and properties to be learned end-to-end with weak   supervision. We build a general-purpose mechanism that enables robots to   generalize their language understanding to compositional domains. Crucially,   our base network has the same state-of-the-art performance as prior work, 97\%   execution accuracy, while at the same time generalizing its knowledge when   prior work does not; for example, achieving 95\% accuracy on novel   adjective-noun compositions where previous work has 55\% average   accuracy. Robust language understanding without dramatic failures and without   corner causes is critical to building safe and fair robots; we demonstrate the   significant role that compositionality can play in achieving that goal."

We presented model addresses many compositionality challenges found gSCAN, dataset specifically designed challenge neural networks.

When compositionality relevant, appears supplant data augmentation provide faster, principled, dataset-agnostic method fewer parameters achieve even better results. When compositionality derived language, enables us include linguistic ideas fundamental part models, like notion synonyms antonyms. The suggestive admittedly tenuous implication work perhaps, grounded robotics develops, use approach test linguistic representations. Many formalisms exist linguistics encoding semantics sentences centuries debate brought us closer agreement. Without independent test formalism better, convergence one notion semantics unlikely. It appears grounded compositional models trained perform tasks, representations significantly better others. It also appears semantic representations are, i.e., abstract away surface syntax language, better resulting robotic model is.

"Query auto completion standard component search engines industry. Given prefix, system returns ranked list completed queries match users' intents. Query auto completion enhances user experience two ways: saves user keystrokes returns search results less time; guides users type ""better"" queries likely lead desirable search results. For example, given prefix ""soft"", ""software engineer"" better query ""software programmer"", since former commonly used job title. A typical QAC system takes generate-then-rank two-step framework. The candidate generation component returns frequent queries match prefix, memorizing mapping prefixes queries based search logs . The candidate ranking component extracts features candidates uses produce final ranking order. Both components involve intense computation whole process finished within several milliseconds, order meet online latency requirements. However, traditional approach fully exploit context query prefix. For example, generation phase, unseen prefixes, last word prefix used generate candidates ; ranking phase, effective feature query frequency collected search log, lacks deep semantics understanding. To enable semantic text understanding, neural networks based methods applied QAC. Early works focus ranking stage: Convolutional Neural Networks adopted measure semantic coherence query prefix suggested suffixes ranking phase.

Generally it has two steps: generating completed query candidates according to query prefixes, and ranking them based on extracted features. Three major challenges are observed for a query auto completion system:  QAC has a strict online latency requirement. For each keystroke, results must be returned within tens of milliseconds, which poses a significant challenge in designing sophisticated language models for it.  For unseen queries, generated candidates are of poor quality as contextual information is not fully utilized.  Traditional QAC systems heavily rely on handcrafted features such as the query candidate frequency in search logs, lacking sufficient semantic understanding of the candidate.  In this paper, we propose an efficient neural QAC system with effective context modeling to overcome these challenges. On the candidate generation side, this system uses as much information as possible in unseen prefixes to generate relevant candidates, increasing the recall by a large margin. On the candidate ranking side, an unnormalized language model is proposed, which effectively captures deep semantics of queries. This approach presents better ranking performance over state-of-the-art neural ranking methods and reduces $\sim$95\% latency compared to neural language modeling methods. The empirical results on public datasets show that our model achieves a good balance between accuracy and efficiency.

"Probabilistic topic models assume words generated latent topics inferred word co-occurrence patterns taking document global context. In recent years, various neural topic models proposed. Some built Variational Auto-Encoder utilizes deep neural networks approximate intractable posterior distribution observed words given latent topics . However, models take bag-of-words representation given document input VAE aim learn hidden topics used reconstruct original document. They learn word embeddings concurrently. Other topic modeling approaches explore pre-trained word embeddings extraction semantically coherent topics since word embeddings capture syntactic semantic regularities encoding local context word co-occurrence patterns. For example, topic-word generation process traditional topic models replaced generating word embeddings given latent topics two-component mixture Dirichlet multinomial component word embedding component . Alternatively, information derived word embeddings used promote semantically-related words Polya Urn sampling process topic models generate topic hierarchies . However, models use pre-trained word embeddings learn word embeddings jointly topics. While word embeddings could improve topic modeling results, conversely, topic information could also benefit word embedding learning. Early word embedding learning methods learn mapping function project word single vector embedding space. Such one-to-one mapping cannot deal word polysemy, word could multiple meanings depending context. For example, word `patient' two possible meanings `enduring trying circumstances even temper' `a person requires medical care'. When analyzing reviews restaurants health services, semantic meaning `patient' could inferred depending topic associated with. One solution first extract topics using standard Latent Dirichlet Allocation model incorporate topical information word embedding learning treating topic pseudo-word . Whereas aforementioned approaches adopt two-step process, either using pre-trained word embeddings improve topic extraction results topic modeling, incorporating topics extracted using standard topic model word embedding learning, \citet{shi2017jointly} developed Skip-Gram based model jointly learn topics word embeddings based Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis , word associated two matrices rather vector induce topic-dependent embeddings. This rather cumbersome setup. \citet{foulds2018mixed} used Skip-Gram imitate probabilistic topic model word represented importance vector topics context generation. In paper propose neural generative model built VAE, called Joint Topic Word-embedding model, jointly learning topics topic-specific word embeddings. More concretely, introduce topics tangible parameters shared across context windows. We assume pivot word generated hidden semantics encoding local context occurred. Then hidden semantics transformed topical distribution taking account global topics, enables generation context words. Our rationale context words generated hidden semantics pivot word together global topic matrix, captures notion word multiple meanings shared across corpus. We thus able learn topics generate topic-dependent word embeddings jointly. The results model also allow visualization word semantics topics visualized via top words words encoded distributions topics\footnote{Our source code made available \url{http://github.com/somethingx02/topical\_wordvec\_models}.}. In summary, contribution three-fold: This paper presents empirical study large-scale semi-supervised learning CTC acoustic models strong offline teacher model used generate pseudo-labels unlabelled data. The unlabelled data selected based confidence domain distribution well speaker content variability. Experimental results two different dialects reinforce efficacy teacher generated pseudo labels importance intelligent data selection methods. It observed domain-specific unlabelled data strong impact corresponding WER little cross-domain impact signifying importance sampling strategy boosting performance low resource domains. Future work direction would devise strategy leverage confidence well domain diversity combined data sampling strategy SSL. Another important future direction study impact word level decoding incorporates lexicon strong language model improving quality teacher generated pseudo-labels."," We propose a novel generative model to explore both local and global context for joint learning topics and topic-specific word embeddings. In particular, we assume that global latent topics are shared across documents, a word is generated by a hidden semantic vector encoding its contextual semantic meaning, and its context words are generated conditional on both the hidden semantic vector and global latent topics. Topics are trained jointly with the word embeddings. The trained model maps words to topic-dependent embeddings, which naturally addresses the issue of word polysemy. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the word-level embedding methods in both word similarity evaluation and word sense disambiguation. Furthermore, the model also extracts more coherent topics compared with existing neural topic models or other models for joint learning of topics and word embeddings. Finally, the model can be easily integrated with existing deep contextualized word embedding learning methods to further improve the performance of downstream tasks such as sentiment classification."

Specifically, \citet{hwang2019sqlova} \citet{he2019xsql} concatenate full table schema NL question feed BERT-alike base language model. However, decoding stage, need hidden representation individual column. Thus, apply adhoc pooling tokens column name get vector column. \citet{hwang2019sqlova} simply pick vector first token ``shallow layer'' added another LSTM layers ``decoder-layer'' ``NL2SQ-Layer''. \citet{he2019xsql} apply weighted average vectors tokens. These ad-hoc pooling operations additional LSTM layers caused information loss bring unnecessary complexity. To solve dilemma encountered previous work, paper, choose encode pair NL question one individual column via exact BERT/RoBERTa model structure. Then multiple sub-tasks decoder stage: SELECT \& WHERE column ranking, condition operator, condition value span. Since decoder output final SQL query, apply straightforward rules assemble decoder outputs final SQL query. Our approach two benefits. First, inputs, i.e., question column pair align perfectly original sentence pair training tasks BERT/RoBERTa, hence, believe power BERT/RoBERTa utilized best. Second, encode one column, ``[CLS]'' vector BERT/RoBERTa output captures fused information question column, exactly ``column vector'' needed decoder. So need apply pooling additional complex layers. This makes model structure simple efficient. Since main philosophy approach ranking columns multi-task outputs, name Hybrid Ranking Network . In summary, contributions three folds. First, propose simple efficient network structure perfectly aligns Text-to-SQL task base language models, hence, power base language models best utilized. Second, base language model encoder directly encodes NL question column without additional pooling operations believed best encoder capturing question-column relation Text-to-SQL. Third, proposed hybrid ranking mechanism execution-guided decoding handle column-column relations effectively boost accuracy. In words, approach resolved aforementioned challenges time. Our approach achieves best result WikiSQL dataset, verifies effectiveness contributions. We argue that, WikiSQL task, columm-column interdependency quite rare. So, main relationship learn columns NL question. So, propose two stage approach paper:\\ In first stage, learn column-question relationships. We consider one column time, form input question-column pair train model classify whether column SELECT WHERE column. \\ In second stage, keep relevant columns first step via ranking use execution-guided decoding construct SQL query. Execution guided decoding takes necessary column-column relationships account. Our approach addresses issues leverages BERT recommended tasks setting input setting input length grow number candidate columns, hence able scale even large databases. \end{comment} There doubt state-of-the-art models text-to-SQL task must leverage pre-trained deep Transformer models like BERT, MT-DNN RoBERTa. However, previous approaches leverage pre-trained contextualized word representation concatenate column names table along NL question encoding layer order learn interdependencies columns SELECT clause WHERE conditions well columns different WHERE conditions . This several serious limitations: \\ BERT pre-trained sentence pairs, sentence sequences \\ prediction could instable column set different. Adding irrelevant column results different input embedding sequence. \\ Number columns could different, makes difficult static computation graph \\ Hard learn interdependencies. sparse. model consider those. exponetially complex serious limitations previously proposed models use contextualized word representations . To overcome issue, propose two stage approach: \\ Predict one attribute time slot: prediction independently. How likely column SELECT clause WHERE condition independent attributes. \\ Model interdependencies use execution guidance assemble: Model interdependies second step. Here, rules application introduced. Generic rules. Application specific rules. EG also used. \\ \end{comment} Driven motivation combining word embedding learning topic modeling mutually benefit other, propose probabilistic generative framework jointly discover semantically coherent latent topics global context also learn topic-specific word embeddings, naturally address problem word polysemy. Experimental results verify effectiveness model word similarity evaluation word sense disambiguation. Furthermore, model discover latent topics shared across documents, encoder JTW generate topical distribution word. This enables intuitive understanding word semantics. We also shown proposed JTW easily integrated deep contextualized word embeddings improve performance downstream tasks. In future work, explore discourse relationships context windows model, example, semantic shift neighboring sentences."," 		In this paper, we study how to leverage pre-trained language models in Text-to-SQL. We argue that previous approaches under utilize the base language models by concatenating all columns together with the NL question and feeding them into the base language model in the encoding stage. We propose a neat approach called Hybrid Ranking Network~ which breaks down the problem into column-wise ranking and decoding and finally assembles the column-wise outputs into a SQL query by straightforward rules. In this approach, the encoder is given a NL question and one individual column, which perfectly aligns with the original tasks BERT/RoBERTa is trained on, and hence we avoid any ad-hoc pooling or additional encoding layers which are necessary in prior approaches. Experiments on the WikiSQL dataset show that the proposed approach is very effective, achieving the top place on the leaderboard."

"} {D}{eep} learning models revolutionized multiple fields information systems including natural language processing , computer vision, speech analysis. While enabled multiple tasks attain high accuracy values, model sizes prediction latencies increased significantly well. Specific text, Recurrent neural networks , Gated Recurrent Units long short term memory networks used quite time various natural language processing tasks. These models large especially input output embedding parameters. %For example, ClueWeb dataset, vocabulary contains 10M words. If embedding vectors 1024 dimensions dimension represented using 32 bits, size input-embedding matrix 40GB. Further considering output-embedding matrix weights hidden layers, RNN model 80GB. In past three years, field NLP made significant progress evident GLUE SuperGLUE leaderboards. Transformer based models like Bidirectional Encoder Representations Transformers , Generative Pre-training Transformer , Multi-task Deep Neural Network , Extra-Long Network , MegatronLM, Text-to-text transfer transformer , T-NLG GShard major contributors success. But models humongous size: BERT , GPT-2 , MegatronLM , T5 , T-NLG GShard . Bianco et al. Sanh et al. provide great overview sizes recent deep learning models computer vision NLP respectively. Deployment gigantic models difficult even high-end servers. Indeed large number real world applications run machines resource constrained environments, example, edge devices, sensors mobile phones. Edge devices could include offline medical equipment, modules drones, robots, glasses, etc. Often times, besides desiring small model size, low response times critical. For example, applications like driverless cars apps aid blind require processing speeds around 30 frames per second. Similarly, search engines need able process billions queries per day. Overall, following factors motivate us study compression deep learning models. Large networks fit on-chip storage hence require costly external DRAM accesses. Running 1 billion connection neural network, example, 30 frames per second would require = 19.2W DRAM access -- well beyond power envelope typical mobile device. This implies mobile phone running app could suffer fast draining battery, leading overheating phone. Han et al. discuss details power dissipation deep learning models. Another option avoid large RAM, high prediction times high power dissipation, run massive deep learning models cloud servers. But many real world applications, desirable run local client devices avoid network delay, guard user privacy avoid power dissipation terms input/output data communication. Small models indeed also lead low prediction latencies. For example, Diamos et al. showed small models, one cache RNN weights on-chip memory caches, block RAM, register files across multiple timesteps. This could lead much 146x speedup entire RNN layer stored registers rather GPU DRAM NVIDIA TitanX GPU. Finally, easier perform software development, deployment updates smaller models. Large models difficult handle. For example, impossible fine-tune pretrained BERT-large model GPU 12-16 GB RAM. This poses large barrier entry communities without resources purchase several large Graphic Processing Units . For large models, tuning various configuration parameters needs lots resources. Smaller models lead improved speed learning allow hyper-parameter configurations evaluated. Mobile-first companies dislike large apps. App stores sensitive size binary files. For example, iPhone App Store restriction ``apps 150 MB download connect Wi-Fi''. Smaller models easier use deploy real world systems. Large models need multiple server nodes. On hand, multiple instances smaller models run simultaneously machine leading higher QPS . Lastly, smaller models also decrease communication overhead distributed training models. Fortunately, large amount redundancy among weights large neural networks. A small subset weights sufficient reconstruct entire network. Denil et al. showed simply using 5\% weights, possible predict remaining weights without drop accuracy.

"In natural language processing, pre-trained contextual representations widely used help downstream tasks lack sufficient labeled training data. Previous works develop various self-supervised tasks obtain pre-trained contextual representations. Taking classic masked language modeling task used BERT example, first randomly chooses small number positions sentence, mask words position learns encoder restore them. As tasks require human supervision, size available training data could easily amount scale billions words. Pre-training large-scale data consumes exceptionally huge computational resources . In paper, tackle training efficiency issue develop novel variance-reduced algorithm better language pretraining. In particular, observe previous works use uniformly sampled positions mask constructing self-supervised tasks, inevitably inefficient optimization perspective. For instance, BERT training, find commonly used words punctuation easy learn, i.e., words correctly predicted model thousands training steps. Meanwhile, rare words phrases difficult predict even end training. If always uniformly sample positions mask, intuitively say, variance stochastic gradient large since positions gradually provide less informative signals not. Usually, learning large-variance gradient estimator inefficient ineffective. To formally characterize variance stochastic gradient, first introduce principled gradient variance decomposition theorem. The theorem shows gradient variance naturally decomposed two parts. One part concerns variance sentences sampled batch, part concerns variance masked positions. Our focus variance reduction second part. Importance sampling standard way variance reduction, suggests sample masks using proposal distribution instead uniform distribution. According theory, variance minimized probability mask sampled proposal distribution proportional gradient norm. However, brings chicken-egg problem: We never know gradient norm unless mask positions, feed masked sentence model back-propagate loss. As number possible masks huge, feeding possibilities network obtain gradients time expensive significantly slows training process. To address challenge, introduce meta-learning approach introducing MAsk Proposal Network takes whole sentence input outputs probability distribution positions sample masks. Both MAP-Net pretraining model jointly optimized adversarial manner. Given masked sentence sampled MAP-Net, model optimized recover masked sentence. At time, MAP-Net receives signals performance model masked sentence, improve itself. Instead using reinforcement learning, decouple learning objective make training MAP-Net easier. We show language generation tasks, use value loss instead value gradient norm. Therefore, goal MAP-Net find ``tough'' masked positions high losses challenge model, model attempts fulfill tasks generated MAP-Net. As obtain loss many masked positions, MAP-Net efficiently optimized pair-wise preference different positions. To demonstrate advantage proposed method, conduct several experiments using MAP-Net help training BERT, evaluate GLUE natural language understanding benchmark . Experiment results first indicate masked words generated MAP-NET meaningful informative training. Furthermore, variance sufficiently reduced, BERT model learned MAP-Net achieves better accuracy baselines tasks. In paper, attempt develop hybrid architecture extract different aspects semantic information linguistic data diverse types neural structures. Intriguingly, propose novel hierarchical multi-granularity attention mechanism, consisting syntactical attention symbolic level semantical attention embedding level, respectively. The experimental results show MahNN model achieves impressive performances variety benchmark datasets text classification task. Moreover, visualization attention distribution illustrates hierarchical multi-granularity attention mechanism effective capturing informative semantics different perspectives. We draw following conclusions work: There several future directions extend work. First, would investigate applying generative model obtain multichannel representations texts. Data augmentation way represent much richer semantics. Second, ConvNets require fixed-length inputs perform unnecessary convolution operations NLP tasks. It worthwhile explore novel ConvNet architecture processing variable length. Moreover, use simple calculating methods attention weights might able demonstrate full potential hierarchical multi-granularity attention mechanism. It would intriguing compute attention weights advanced approaches transfer learning reinforcement learning improve performance."," Self-supervised learning, a.k.a., pretraining, is important in natural language processing. Most of the pretraining methods first randomly mask some positions in a sentence and then train a model to recover the tokens at the masked positions. In such a way, the model can be trained without human labeling, and the massive data can be used with billion parameters. Therefore, the optimization efficiency becomes critical.  In this paper, we tackle the problem from the view of gradient variance reduction. In particular, we first propose a principled gradient variance decomposition theorem, which shows that the variance of the stochastic gradient of the language pretraining can be naturally decomposed into two terms: the variance that arises from the sample of data in a batch, and the variance that arises from the sampling of the mask. The second term is the key difference between self-supervised learning and supervised learning, which makes the pretraining slower. In order to reduce the variance of the second part, we leverage the importance sampling strategy, which aims at sampling the masks according to a proposal distribution instead of the uniform distribution. It can be shown that if the proposal distribution is proportional to the gradient norm, the variance of the sampling is reduced. To improve efficiency, we introduced a MAsk Proposal Network , which approximates the optimal mask proposal distribution and is trained end-to-end along with the model. According to the experimental result, our model converges much faster and achieves higher performance than the baseline BERT model."
"Written Chinese explicit word boundary, Chinese word segmentation serves upstream disambiguation step Chinese language processing.

Then, BERT model trained recover masked sentence sampled MAP-Net, instead uniform distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate MAP-Net better downstream tasks. It outperforms BERT GLUE tasks less training steps. In future, continue exploring methods reduce variance pretraining, e.g., smartly select batched sentences."," % Supervised Chinese word segmentation has been widely approached as sequence labeling or sequence modeling. Recently, some researchers attempted to treat it as character-level translation, but there is still a performance gap between the translation-based approach and other methods. In this work, we apply the best practices from low-resource neural machine translation to Chinese word segmentation. We build encoder-decoder models with attention, and examine a series of techniques including regularization, data augmentation, objective weighting, transfer learning and ensembling. When benchmarked on MSR corpus under closed test condition without additional data, our method achieves 97.6\% F1, which is on a par with the state of the art and remarkably better than previous translation-based methods. Supervised Chinese word segmentation has entered the deep learning era which reduces the hassle of feature engineering.

"Dialogue state modules central component task-oriented dialogue system. Given user utterance existing dialogue history, dialogue system typically extracts dialogue states, according system response generated. An example shown Figure, given two turns dialogue, first user utterance ``I want expensive restaurant serves Turkish food.'', dialogue states consist slot-value pairs . As dialogue proceeds, dialogue state updated turn. After tow dialogue turns, dialogue state becomes , inform represents search constraints expressed user request represents search target user asking for. In example, user intention reserve restaurant. The business domain restaurant customer service. The dialogue state represents user looking current turn conversation. % While traditional dialogue state tracking modules extract user intention slot values pipeline [], recent work performances end-to-end DST extracting slot-value pairs only. {\bf While traditional dialogue state tracking performed spoken language understanding module , recent work perform end-to-end DST joint modeling SLU DST.} % Recent work focused scalability DST, unknown slot values problem multi-domain problem , aim simulate real-world applications.

The supervised learning task called Dialogue State Tracking . One limitation supervised learning manual labeling process slow costly given certain domain customer service. Available datasets labeled popular domains restaurant, taxi, train hotel. However, practice, number customer service domains ranges far beyond hundreds , makes infeasible manually label corpora every domain. In addition, shown ratio annotation errors high 30\% even 40\% DST task . %Due reason, relies manually annotated datasets, mostly constructed using Wizard-of-Oz approach based fixed pre-defined ontology. restricts ability learn large data since dialogue state difficult part annotate conversation. As shown figure ???, sample difficulty. Most existing task-oriented datasets originally benchmark DSTC2\&3 recently popular MultiWOZ instead real-word customer service conversations. Mostly recently proposed datasets Though recently proposed datasets including including DSTC2, KVRET MultiWOZ etc, SGD, Taskmaster-1 MultiDoGo ary trying increase magnitude domains, slots values. % Many human-human conversations accessible real life applications, nearly impossible annotate dialogue states huge complicated conversations even backend API database cannot provided. %for example, Twitter corpus released Kaggle \footnote{https://www.kaggle.com/thoughtvector/customer-support-on-twitter}, contains three million tweets replies customer support agents big companies customers Ubuntu dialogue corpus . %In occasions, gather dialogue state information solely based conversation utterances realistic. To address issue, useful automatically induce dialogue states raw dialogues. We assume large set dialogue records many different domains, without manual labeling dialogue states. Such data relatively easy obtain, example customer service call records different businesses. Consequently, propose task {\bf dialogue state induction} , automatically induce slot-value pairs raw dialogue data better used downstream dialogue tasks database query, act prediction response generation. The difference DSI DST illustrated Figure. Similar DST models, DSI outputs dialogue states slot-value pairs , price represents slot, expensive represents value. For requestable slots , request regarded slot area regarded value. During training, DST relies dialogue record manual labeling slot-value pairs dialogues. In contrast, task rely manual labeling generate slot-value pairs raw dialogues automatically. % During testing, existing methods rely ontology trained model label slot values dialogues, method rely ontology. {\bf existing methods considering unlabelled training data rely ontology, supervised models rely ontology.} % To address problem, introduce new task called dialogue state induction , aims automatically discover dialogue states human-human conversations without annotation.

Such a system subsumes both automatic speech recognition  as well as natural language understanding . An end-to-end joint SLU model can be built to a required specification opening up the opportunity to deploy on hardware constrained scenarios like devices enabling voice assistants to work offline, in a privacy preserving manner, whilst also reducing server costs.   % removed word ""composed"" from joint system description We first present models that extract utterance intent directly from speech without intermediate text output. We then present a compositional model, which generates the transcript using the Listen Attend Spell ASR system and then extracts interpretation using a neural NLU model. Finally, we contrast these methods to a jointly trained end-to-end joint SLU model, consisting of ASR and NLU subsystems which are connected by a neural network based interface instead of text, that produces transcripts as well as NLU interpretation. We show that the jointly trained model shows improvements to ASR incorporating semantic information from NLU and also improves NLU by exposing it to ASR confusion encoded in the hidden layer."
"Modularized task-oriented dialogues systems core current smart speaker generation . The main modules systems Natural Language Understanding , Dialogue State Tracking , Dialogue Policy Natural Language Generation , trained separately using supervised and/or reinforcement learning. Thus data collection process required, tasks laborious expensive. For example, dialogue policy annotation done expert, better professional linguist. Therefore, model requires samples actually perform well tasks essential. The successful approach few-shot learning task-oriented dialogue systems notably transfer learning, large model firstly pre-trained large corpus fine-tuned specific tasks. For task-oriented dialogue systems, ~\citet{wu2020tod} proposed \href{https://github.com/jasonwu0731/ToD-BERT}{TOD-BERT} large pre-trained model achieve better performance BERT few-shots NLU, DST DP. \citet{liu2020coach} proposed two-step classification few-shot slot-filling, key task NLU module. Similarly, \citet{peng2020few} introduced benchmark few-shot NLG pre-trained language model specialized task. Further, template rewriting schema based T5 developed \citet{kale2020few} few-shot NLG two well-known datasets. \citet{peng2020soloist} proposed pre-trained language model end-to-end pipe-lined task-oriented dialogue systems. In experiments, showed promising few-shot learning performance MWoZ. Finally, several meta-learning approaches proposed DP, NLG/ACT, pipelined end-to-end models personalized dialogue systems. For performing few-shot learning, existing methods require set task-specific parameters since model fine-tuned samples. Differently, paper, perform few-shot learning priming LMs few-examples. In setting, parameters updated, thus allowing single model perform multiple tasks time. In paper, evaluate few-shot ability LM priming four task-oriented tasks previously mentioned . Currently, GPT-3 available public; thus experiment different sizes GPT-2 models SMALL , LARGE , XL . All experiments run single NVIDIA 1080Ti GPU. We developed models problem spoken language understanding extracting natural language intent named-entities slots directly speech. Such end-to-end model customized deployed resource constrained device enabling new offline privacy focussed use cases. We first developed audio intent model small footprint. We developed compositional model pretrained LAS ASR model whose outputs, transcription audio, fed pre-trained neural NLU model. Finally, end-to-end fully differentiable, interpretable Joint SLU model presented NLU system consumes transcript output LAS system neural network interface encodes ASR word confusion. These models trained multiple datasets affirmed following points: intent classification performance improves ASR outputs also produced replacing text wordpiece interface compositional ASR NLU systems neural network hidden joint training leads 2.7+\ relative improvement NLU metrics intents, slots mitigates downstream impact ASR errors joint training reduces ASR WER 3.8\ backpropagation NLU losses ASR layers."," Task-oriented dialogue systems use four connected modules, namely, Natural Language Understanding , a Dialogue State Tracking , Dialogue Policy  and Natural Language Generation . A research challenge is to learn each module with the least amount of samples  given the high cost related to the data collection. The most common and effective technique to solve this problem is transfer learning, where large language models, either pre-trained on text or task-specific data, are fine-tuned on the few samples. These methods require fine-tuning steps and a set of parameters for each task. Differently, language models, such as GPT-2 and GPT-3, allow few-shot learning by priming the model with few examples. In this paper, we evaluate the priming few-shot ability of language models in the NLU, DST, DP and NLG tasks. Importantly, we highlight the current limitations of this approach, and we discuss the possible implication to future work."

These properties of social networks which are known as 5'Vs of big data has led to many unique and enlightenment algorithms and techniques applied to large social networking datasets and data streams. Many of these researches are based on detection and tracking of hot topics and trending social media events that help revealing many unanswered questions. These algorithms and in some cases software products mostly rely on the nature of the language itself. Although, other techniques such as unsupervised data mining methods are language independent but many requirements for a comprehensive solution are not met. Many research issues such as noisy sentences that adverse grammar and new online user invented words are challenging maintenance of a good social network topic detection and tracking methodology; The semantic relationship between words and in most cases, synonyms are also ignored by many of these researches. In this research, we use Transformers combined with an incremental community detection algorithm. Transformer in one hand, provides the semantic relation between words in different contexts. On the other hand, the proposed graph mining technique enhances the resulting topics with aid of simple structural rules. Named entity recognition from multimodal data, image and text, labels the named entities with entity type and the extracted topics are tuned using them. All operations of proposed system has been applied with big social data perspective under NoSQL technologies. In order to present a working and systematic solution, we combined MongoDB with Neo4j as two major database systems of our work. The proposed system shows higher precision and recall compared to other methods in three different datasets."

Most of the existing systems either treat them as separate tasks or just jointly model the two tasks by sharing parameters in an implicit way without explicitly  modeling mutual interaction and relation. To address this problem, we propose a Deep Co-Interactive Relation Network  to explicitly consider the cross-impact and model the interaction between the two tasks by introducing a co-interactive relation layer. In addition, the proposed relation layer can be stacked to gradually capture mutual knowledge with multiple steps of interaction. Especially, we thoroughly study different relation layers and their effects. Experimental results on two public datasets  show that  our model outperforms the state-of-the-art joint model by 4.3\% and 3.4\% in terms of F1 score on dialog act recognition task, 5.7\% and 12.4\% on sentiment classification respectively. Comprehensive analysis empirically verifies the effectiveness of explicitly modeling the relation between the two tasks and the multi-steps interaction mechanism. Finally, we employ the Bidirectional Encoder  Representation from Transformer  in our framework, which can further boost our performance in both tasks."
"Neural modeling approaches prominent research task-oriented open-domain dialog. Traditional sequence-to-sequence models used encoding dialog history predicting domains, intents, slot types, spans generally decoding full-fledged system responses. In recent years, large pre-trained Transformer-based models natural language understanding natural language generation become ubiquitous, leading tremendous advances fine-tuning towards dialog tasks. % In task-oriented speech-based dialog systems, effect ASR hypotheses widely studied techniques devised minimize resulting downstream NLU errors.

However, research on building such chatbots has typically assumed that the user input is written in nature and it is not clear whether these chatbots would seamlessly integrate with automatic speech recognition  models to serve the speech modality. We aim to bring attention to this important question by empirically studying the effects of various types of synthetic and actual ASR hypotheses in the dialog history on TransferTransfo, a state-of-the-art Generative Pre-trained Transformer  based neural open-domain dialog system from the NeurIPS ConvAI2 challenge. We observe that TransferTransfo trained on written data is very sensitive to such hypotheses introduced to the dialog history during inference time.   %with the sensitivity being particularly prominent for the task of response selection.   As a baseline mitigation strategy, we introduce synthetic ASR hypotheses to the dialog history during training and observe marginal improvements, demonstrating the need for further research into techniques to make end-to-end open-domain chatbots fully speech-robust. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the effects of synthetic and actual ASR hypotheses on a state-of-the-art neural open-domain dialog system and we hope it promotes speech-robustness as an evaluation criterion in open-domain dialog."
"Knowledge Graph consists facts form triplet using corresponding relation tail embeddings, calculate plausibility triplet measuring difference original reconstructed embeddings.

While various forms of models are proposed for the link prediction task, most of them are designed based on a few known relation patterns in several well-known datasets. Due to the diversity and complexity nature of the real-world KGs, it is inherently difficult to design a model that fits all datasets well. To address this issue, previous work has tried to use Automated Machine Learning  to search for the best model for a given dataset. However, their search space is limited only to bilinear model families. In this paper, we propose a novel Neural Architecture Search  framework for the link prediction task.  First, the embeddings of the input triplet are refined by the Representation Search Module. Then, the prediction score is searched within the Score Function Search Module. This framework entails a more general search space, which enables us to take advantage of several mainstream model families, and thus it can potentially achieve better performance.  We relax the search space to be continuous so that the architecture can be optimized efficiently using gradient-based search strategies. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared with several state-of-the-art approaches."

"Non-autoregressive transformer~ attracted wide attention neural machine translation~, generates sentences simultaneously rather sequentially. To enable parallel decoding, NAT imposes conditional independence assumption among words output sentences, leads significantly faster inference speed~ autoregressive Transformer~. However, NAT still falls behind autoregressive Transformer~ quality output sentences, BLEU~ machine translation. %\zhouh{move BLEU citations} We blame imposed conditional independence assumption, prevents NAT models explicitly learning word dependencies output sentence. Note word dependency crucial, explicitly learned AT model autoregressive language models~. Recently, \citet{mask_predict,levT} propose employ Masked Language Model~ NAT, includes word dependency modeling iterative fashion~, therefore yielding quite competitive results compared AT. Specifically, iterative models randomly mask words reference predict masked words conditioned unmasked ones training. In manner, iterative models trained explicitly capture dependencies masked words unmasked words. However, iterative approaches still produce poor results one decoding iteration perform multiple iterations inference, namely iteratively refining generated outputs previous iteration. Such iterative process quite time-consuming, partly sacrifices speed merit NAT. To date, remains open question iterative process abandoned, still preserving benefits explicitly modeling word dependencies NAT. In paper, argue major culprit problem mask language models used together iterative inference, sampling strategy masking words MLM. In particular, MLM employs fixed uniform strategy randomly masking words training, prevents model effectively learning word dependencies one-iteration generation. For example, beginning training NAT model still poorly tuned, mask fewer words. If not, would difficult NAT model correctly predict masked words. % In worst case, NAT model may stuck local minimums training, prevents NAT model well fitting training data. On contrary, mask little words end phase training, resulting NAT model rarely trained predict whole sentences, predict sentence fragments. In case, accurately generate whole sentence inference, NAT model generate sentence fragments iteratively. To end, sampling strategy crucial training NAT. To address issues, propose simple yet effective approach called Glancing Transformer~, equipped proposed Glancing Language Model~ non-iterative parallel text generation, achieving significant improvements upon strong baselines. Intuitively, GLM adopts adaptive glancing sampling strategy, glances fragments reference reference difficult fit training NAT. Correspondingly, model well tuned, adaptively reduce percentage glancing sampling, making sure resulting model could learn generate whole sentence one-iteration fashion. Specifically, proposed GLM differs MLM two aspects. Firstly, GLM proposes adaptive glancing sampling strategy, enables \method generate sentences one-iteration way, working gradual training instead iterative inference~. % Intuitively, GLM works like way Generally, GLM quite similar curriculum learning~ spirit, namely first learning generate fragments gradually moving learn whole sentences~. To achieve adaptive glancing sampling, GLM performs decoding twice training. The first decoding vanilla NAT, prediction accuracy indicates whether current reference ``difficult'' fitting. In second decoding, GLM gets words reference via glancing sampling according first decoding, learn predict remaining words sampled. Note second decoding update model parameters. Secondly, instead using token, GLM directly use representations encoder corresponding positions, natural could enhance interactions sampled words signals encoder. Experimental results show \method obtains significant improvements standard benchmarks compared vanilla NAT, without losing inference speed-up. \method achieves competitive results iterative approaches like Mask-Predict~, even outperforming Mask-Predict model WMT14 DE-EN WMT16 RO-EN. % Considering fully NAT models one-iteration simultaneous generation, \method achieves best BLEU scores. Compared strong AT baseline, \method still close performance gap within 1 BLEU point keeping speed-up. Empirically, find \method outperforms AT source input length less 20 WMT14 DE-EN. We speculate GLM could capture bidirectional context left-to-right LM unidirectional, indicates potential parallel generation models. We show feasible train Transformers depth previously believed difficult. Using ADMIN initialization, build Transformer-based models 60 encoder layers 12 decoder layers. On WMT'14 EN-FR WMT'14 EN-EN, deep models outperform conventional 6-layer Transformers 2.5 BLEU, obtain state-of-the-art results. We believe ability train deep models may open new avenues research NMT, including: Training extremely large noisy data, e.g. back-translation adversarial training , see exploited larger model capacity. Analyzing internal representations, see deeper networks indeed extract higher-level features syntax semantics . Compressing deep model via e.g. knowledge distillation , study trade-offs size translation quality. Analyzing deep models work theory."," %Non-autoregressive models generate all the tokens of the sequence in parallel.  Although non-autoregressive models with one-iteration generation achieve remarkable inference speed-up, they still fall behind their autoregressive counterparts in prediction accuracy. The non-autoregressive models with the best accuracy currently rely on multiple decoding iterations, which largely sacrifice the inference speed of non-autoregressive models.  Inspired by the way of learning word dependencies in autoregressive and iterative-decoding models, we propose Glancing Transformer~ with a glancing language model~, which learns to capture the word dependency gradually. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve the accuracy of non-autoregressive models without multiple decoding iterations. In particular, \method achieves state-of-the-art results among non-iterative models and even outperforms top iterative counterparts in some specific benchmarks."

Could NLP models work without the embedding component? To that end, we omit the input and output embeddings from a standard machine translation model, and represent text as a sequence of bytes via UTF-8 encoding, using a constant 256-dimension one-hot representation for each byte. Experiments on 10 language pairs show that removing the embedding matrix consistently improves the performance of byte-to-byte models, often outperforms character-to-character models, and sometimes even produces better translations than standard subword models.\footnote{Our code is publicly available at: \url{https://github.com/UriSha/EmbeddinglessNMT}}"

Tables display information as a two-dimensional matrix, the semantics of which is conveyed by a mixture of structure , headers, caption, and content. Recent research has started to consider tables as first class objects, not just as an addendum to texts, yielding interesting results for problems like table matching, table completion, or value imputation. All of these problems inherently rely on an accurate measure for the semantic similarity of two tables. We present TabSim, a novel method to compute table similarity scores using deep neural networks. Conceptually, TabSim represents a table as a learned concatenation of embeddings of its caption, its content, and its structure. Given two tables in this representation, a Siamese neural network is trained to compute a score correlating with the tables' semantic similarity. To train and evaluate our method, we created a gold standard corpus consisting of 1500 table pairs extracted from biomedical articles and manually scored regarding their degree of similarity, and adopted two other corpora originally developed for a different yet similar task. Our evaluation shows that TabSim outperforms other table similarity measures on average by app. 7\% pp F1-score in a binary similarity classification setting and by app. 1.5\% pp in a ranking scenario."

Ideally, would like all-neural model whose layers project audio signal hidden semantic representations, the-so-called ""thought vectors"" infer domain, intent, slots implied audio signal. To achieve goal, several groups conducted experiments using non-ASR awareness E2E SLU. These models usually apply multiple stack RNNs encode entire utterance vector fed fully connected feedforward neural network followed soft-mask max-pool layer identify domain, intent, slot. These models treat unique combination domain, intent, slots output label. For reason, call type E2E SLU classification-based approaches. The limitation classification-based approaches combination domains, intents, slots may grow exponentially, subsequently deal classification problem many number output labels; moreover, number intents usually fixed makes usability classification-based approaches limited.

In contrast, extracting semantic information audio signals, usually need scan entire audio. Similar neural machine translation , E2E SLU models massively benefit attention mechanism.

While the neural transformers consistently deliver the best performance among the state-of-the-art neural architectures in field of natural language processing ,  their merits in a closely related field, i.e.,  spoken language understanding   have not beed investigated. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end neural transformer-based SLU model that can predict the variable-length domain, intent, and slots  vectors embedded in an audio signal with no intermediate token prediction architecture. This new architecture leverages the self-attention mechanism by which the audio signal is transformed to various sub-subspaces allowing to extract the semantic context implied by an utterance. Our end-to-end  transformer SLU predicts the domains, intents  and slots in the Fluent Speech  Commands dataset with accuracy equal to 98.1 \%, 99.6 \%, and 99.6 \%, respectively and outperforms the SLU models that leverage a combination of recurrent and convolutional neural networks by 1.4 \%   while the size of our model is  25\% smaller than  that of these architectures.  Additionally, due to independent sub-space projections in the self-attention layer,  the model is highly parallelizable which makes it a good candidate for on-device SLU."

However, surprisingly enough, straightforward single token/nominal chunk--concept alignment or dictionary lookup techniques such as DBpedia Spotlight still prevail. We propose a generic open-domain OOV-oriented extractive model that is based on distant supervision of a pointer--generator network leveraging bidirectional LSTMs and a copy mechanism. The model has been trained on a large annotated corpus compiled specifically for this task from 250K Wikipedia pages, and tested on regular pages, where the pointers to other pages are considered as ground truth concepts. The outcome of the experiments shows that our model significantly outperforms standard techniques and, when used on top of DBpedia Spotlight, further improves its performance. The experiments furthermore show that the model can be readily ported to other datasets on which it equally achieves a state-of-the-art performance.  \keywords{Open-domain discourse texts \and Concept extraction \and Pointer-generator neural network \and Distant supervision}"
"This paper describes socialbot open-domain conversation, Chirpy Cardinal, built research platform 2019 Alexa Prize competition. During competition, US-based Amazon Alexa users could give invocation phrase connected one competing socialbots . After receiving minimal orientation phrase beginning conversation, user talks socialbot decide end conversation -- point, invited provide rating comment. To provide convincing user experience, open-domain conversational agent must excel language understanding, language generation, emotional engagement, memory, world knowledge conversational planning, among desirable characteristics -- ambitious goal! Prior work within outside Alexa Prize competition taken successful strategy pushing progress along individual skills, forming ensemble sub-systems, excelling singular characteristic ignoring others. For instance, supporting user initiative open-domain conversations extremely challenging, requires understanding countless ways user take initiative, ability respond specificity. Faced difficulty, comes in-depth conversations, many previous dialogue systems rely primarily bot-initiative, driving users along carefully scripted paths. On hand, systems attempting higher user-initiative via non-scripted paths likely lead towards shallower conversations. Thus lot room innovation research trying simultaneously achieve two complementary characteristics; recurring theme throughout work. Our goal building socialbot offer natural-sounding emotionally engaging dialogue agent talk knowledgeably wide variety topics, also letting user take much initiative possible. Initiative -- ability drive direction conversation -- studied extensively context task-oriented dialogue. Mixed initiative , user bot share initiative, important quality successful dialogue system, provides user sense agency without making entirely responsible suggesting new topics directions. In order improve mixed initiative still providing acceptable conversational depth, designed initial system rely heavily system initiative, time explored several avenues increase user initiative controlled fashion. To support mixed initiative, system global navigational intent classifier entity tracker , allowing track high level topic changes user bot. Further, response priority system allows individual Response Generators interject user initiates change topic. High-coverage world knowledge important component open-domain conversation -- bot must able talk diverse range entities topics interest users, particularly wish respect user initiative. We use Alexa Knowledge Graph, The Washington Post, Reddit Twitter sources up-to-date knowledge particular domains, ensuring high coverage using Wikipedia Wikidata entities foundation entity-based conversations . However, world knowledge must delivered conversational style -- characteristic distinguishes socialbot virtual assistant. To achieve this, finetuned neural generative model TopicalChat dataset obtain conversational paraphrasing model adapts external text conversational style . A socialbot cannot focus solely external entities -- truly social, must able discuss personal experiences emotions. While ELIZA-like systems attempt via templated repetition user phrases, lack naturalness depth real human conversations. Our Neural Chat module invites user share everyday experiences current emotions, uses neural generative model respond empathetically. With it, attempt deep, sustained emotionally engaging conversation user's lives. In addition, Opinion module allows user express feelings expressing likes dislikes. To foster reciprocal atmosphere, bot also shares distinct feelings, experiences opinions. Lastly, note advent large-scale pretrained neural generative models substantially impacted possible open-domain socialbots. While last Alexa Prize competition, none top three socialbots used neural generation , found current GPT-2 models key tool support design goals. Neural generation enables natural phrasing emotional engagement, well flexible responsiveness , supporting higher user initiative. A limitation neural generation methods dialogue deterioration quality consistency long conversation, potentially overcome symbolic constraints. We explore ways bring best worlds -- long term consistency short term fluidity -- together. Despite first-time entrant, end competition system achieved rating 3.6/5.0, within 0.1 highest-ranked systems, capable detailed, sustained conversations interested users . Qualitatively, in-person interactions users, observed many innovations in-depth discussions everyday life, conversational styling informational content, opinionated exchanges received expressions pleasant surprise -- indicating steps right direction. In \secref{sec:analysis}, re-examine goals set achieve, empirically analyze bot's successes failures.

In order facilitate solid evaluation proposed model compare series baselines, utilized Wikipedia pages text snippet links sparsely concept-annotated dataset. To ensure model capable extracting generic concepts instead detecting texts page links, ignored sparse annotation training. Instead, compiled large densely concept-annotated dataset leveraging within distant supervision using algorithm described above. To best knowledge, dataset available far.

Our socialbot engages users on their terms -- prioritizing their interests, feelings and autonomy.  As a result, our socialbot provides a responsive, personalized user experience, capable of talking knowledgeably about a wide variety of topics, as well as chatting empathetically about ordinary life. Neural generation plays a key role in achieving these goals, providing the backbone for our conversational and emotional tone.

"Clinical Named Entity Recognition extracts patient information unstructured Electronic Health Records , important task clinical research. The main goal CNER identify clinical terminologies EHRs, diseases, symptoms, treatments, exams body parts. Accurate identification clinical concepts provide effective decision support patient care treatment. Compared English texts, CNER Chinese texts difficult since Chinese EHRs recorded without explicit word delimiters. In recent years, CNER attracted considerable research efforts, many methods proposed literature. Most deep learning methods. Although many advanced models developed CNER, performance still heavily depends manually-annotated training data. Labeling EHRs usually time-consuming expensive EHRs involve many complex clinical terminologies, labelers medical background qualified clinical annotation. It thus becomes rather difficult train effective model CNER since requires large number manually-annotated clinical texts. Active learning, iteratively selects informative samples labelers annotate, effective method reduce annotation cost. It widely used many Natural Language Processing tasks, text classification event recognition. In conventional active learning, one labeler algorithm queries labels selected instances labeler, always returns ground truth queried labels. However, many real settings, multiple labelers, usually provide diverse quality annotation different costs. Obviously, labeler offers better overall quality require higher cost query. The overall quality labelers assessed according previous annotation performance. Moreover, labelers may diverse expertise different instances. For example, CNER tasks, labelers may good labeling diseases, skilled symptoms. Therefore, need consider querying annotate selected instances keep trade-off quality cost. In past years, active learning multiple noisy labelers received significant attention achieved great success various applications. However, many works either ignored different expertise multiple labelers queried labeler instances globally neglected annotation costs different labelers. Recently, two methods considering diversity labelers expertise query costs proposed classification tasks. Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness two methods selecting cost-effective queries. We thus follow trend focus CNER task first time. In paper, propose Cost-Quality Adaptive Active Learning method CNER Chinese EHRs, selects cost-effective instance-labeler pairs obtain better annotation performance lower costs adaptive manner. Specifically, first combine three sampling strategies, namely uncertainty, entropy margin assess informativeness instances. We observe labeler low quality overall annotation still assign accurate labels specific instances real settings. Then, based fact, instance, select suitable labeler offers high-quality yet cheap annotations keep balance annotation quality, labeling costs, informativeness instances. The main contributions paper summarized follows: The rest paper organized follows. Section briefly reviews related work CNER active learning. Section presents proposed cost-quality adaptive active learning method Chinese CNER, followed experimental evaluations Section . Finally, conclusions potential research directions summarized Section . \customparagraph{Full Stack NLP} Most NLP research focuses self-contained tasks. However, open-domain socialbot, served diverse range customers widely different contexts, means self-contained task. Our socialbot tapestry many components, requiring deep understanding component work together -- setting call Full Stack NLP. Often inputs outputs components inter-dependent, leading cascading errors. We made many design choices delay hard decisions pipelines, maximize information exchange modules. Moving forward, next avenue advancing state-of-the-art would research models perform tasks jointly methods enable training multiple interdependent tasks small amount joint supervision. \customparagraph{Domain Shift} As recurring problem, found many existing NLP resources work well out-the-box. The main reason training data resources misaligned setting . However, deeper reason constantly changing nature dialogue agents themselves. Even extremely related resource , domain shift problem. Recent advances online- meta-learning could provide useful long term solution issue. \customparagraph{Conflict Intimacy} Bot-human conversations fundamentally different human-human conversations. Users adversarial, deliberately testing bot's boundaries. As socialbot designers, eager avoid disaster like Microsoft Tay, apply strict overly simplistic methods block sensitive topics . However, rules sincere conversation difficult topics. We observed users actually quite resilient conflict, find disagreement stimulating . We also found emotional intimacy reciprocal -- users inclined share feelings bot shared . Going forward, continue take seriously dangers speaking inappropriately, keep mind cost -- engagement intimacy -- engaging difficult topics. \customparagraph{Initiative} As part goal support user initiative, focused asking users questions find topics interested them. However, puts pressure user think response, especially given time constraints Alexa devices. Thus found attempts let user take initiative unfortunately led decision fatigue. Separately, ability support user initiative limited ability answer followup questions, correctly understand long unexpected user utterances. On balance, found asking user open-ended questions interesting topics good strategy -- easier handle spontaneous user questions, less pressuring asking users name topics. We see opportunity future work build systems listen user's knowledge, rather providing knowledge.","  Clinical Named Entity Recognition  aims to automatically identity clinical terminologies in Electronic Health Records , which is a fundamental and crucial step for clinical research. To train a high-performance model for CNER, it usually requires a large number of EHRs with high-quality labels. However, labeling EHRs, especially Chinese EHRs, is time-consuming and expensive. One effective solution to this is active learning, where a model asks labelers to annotate data which the model is uncertain of. Conventional active learning assumes a single labeler that always replies noiseless answers to queried labels. However, in real settings, multiple labelers provide diverse quality of annotation with varied costs and labelers with low overall annotation quality can still assign correct labels for some specific instances. In this paper, we propose a Cost-Quality Adaptive Active Learning  approach for CNER in Chinese EHRs, which maintains a balance between the annotation quality, labeling costs, and the informativeness of selected instances. Specifically, CQAAL selects cost-effective instance-labeler pairs to achieve better annotation quality with lower costs in an adaptive manner. Computational results on the CCKS-2017 Task 2 benchmark dataset demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed CQAAL."

"Attention-based transformer networks~ widely used sequence modeling tasks, including language modeling machine translation. To improve performance, models often scaled either wider, increasing dimension hidden layers, deeper, stacking transformer blocks. For example, T5 uses dimension 65K GPT-3 uses 96 transformer blocks. However, scaling increases number network parameters significantly , complicates learning, i.e., models either require large training corpora careful regularization . In paper, introduce new parameter-efficient attention-based architecture easily scaled wide deep. Our ep t-weight ransformer architecture, \arch, extends transformer architecture \citet{vaswani2017attention} delivers similar better performance significantly fewer parameters operations. At heart \arch~is \dextra~that uses group linear transformations \citet{mehta2018pyramidal} expand-reduce strategy varying width depth \arch~block efficiently. Since GLTs local nature, \dextra~uses feature shuffling, analogous channel shuffling convolutional networks , share information different groups. Such wide deep representations facilitate replacing multi-head attention feed-forward layers transformers single headed attention light-weight feed-forward layers, reducing total network parameters operations.

The new Hopfield network can store  exponentially  many patterns,  retrieves the pattern with one update, and has exponentially small retrieval errors. It has three types of energy minima :  global fixed point averaging over all patterns,   metastable states averaging over a subset of patterns, and   fixed points which store a single pattern. The new update rule  is equivalent to the attention mechanism used in transformers. This equivalence enables a  characterization of the heads of transformer models. These heads perform in the first layers preferably global averaging and in higher layers partial averaging  via metastable states.  The new modern Hopfield network can be integrated  into deep learning architectures  as layers to allow the storage of and access to  raw input data, intermediate results, or learned prototypes. These Hopfield layers enable new ways of deep learning,  beyond fully-connected, convolutional, or recurrent networks, and provide pooling, memory, association, and attention mechanisms. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the Hopfield layers across various domains. Hopfield layers improved state-of-the-art on three out of four considered multiple instance learning problems as well as on immune repertoire classification with several hundreds of thousands of instances. On the UCI benchmark collections of small classification tasks,  where deep learning methods typically struggle,  Hopfield layers yielded a new state-of-the-art when compared to different machine learning methods. Finally, Hopfield layers achieved state-of-the-art on two drug design datasets. The implementation is available at: \url{https://github.com/ml-jku/hopfield-layers}"

Although possible automatically crawl web~ collect parallel sentences high-resource language pairs German-English Chinese-English, often infeasible expensive manually translate large amounts documents low-resource language pairs, e.g., Nepali-English, Sinhala-English~. Much recent progress low-resource machine translation, driven idea universal machine translation , also known multilingual machine translation~, aims training one single NMT translate multiple source target languages. Typical UMT models leverage either single shared encoder language-specific encoders map source languages shared space, translate source sentences target language decoder. Inspired idea UMT, recent trend towards learning language-invariant embeddings multiple source languages shared latent space, eases cross-lingual generalization high-resource languages low-resource languages many tasks, e.g., parallel corpus mining~, sentence classification~, cross-lingual information retrieval~, dependency parsing~, name few.

Informally highlight first theorem follows, provide formal statements Theorems . To answer second question, show fairly mild generative assumptions aligned documents pairwise translations, possible well pairwise translations, also able seeing aligned documents linear number languages, rather quadratic one. We summarize second theorem follows, provide formal statement Theorem. \paragraph{Notation Setup} We first introduce notation used throughout paper briefly describe problem setting universal machine translation.

Given language , sentence sequence symbols , denote set sentences generated . Note since principle different languages could share alphabet, avoid ambiguity, language , unique token .

Given joint distribution, also use mean marginal distribution sentences . Likewise use denote corresponding marginal distribution sentences . Finally, two sets , use denote disjoint union .

It crucial diagnose two conditions accurately patients appropriate treatment. While many machine learning based studies learn clinical interviews automatically screen mental health conditions, detection BD BPD still understudied.

We demonstrated good performance three classification tasks using down-selected features new way summarising features based path signatures. Lastly, showed importance linguistic features three tasks benefits feature fusion different modalities. For future work, plan learn acoustic features, investigate effect acoustic properties interviews impact recording environments."," The goal of universal machine translation is to learn to translate between any pair of languages, given a corpus of paired translated documents for a small subset of all pairs of languages. Despite impressive empirical results and an increasing interest in massively multilingual models, theoretical analysis on translation errors made by such universal machine translation models is only nascent.   In this paper, we formally prove certain impossibilities of this endeavour in general, as well as prove positive results in the presence of additional  structure of data.   For the former, we derive a lower bound on the translation error in the many-to-many translation setting, which shows that any algorithm aiming to learn shared sentence representations among multiple language pairs has to make a large translation error on at least one of the translation tasks, if no assumption on the structure of the languages is made.   For the latter, we show that if the paired documents in the corpus follow a natural encoder-decoder generative process, we can expect a natural notion of ``generalization'': a linear number of language pairs, rather than quadratic, suffices to learn a good representation. Our theory also explains what kinds of connection graphs between pairs of languages are better suited: ones with longer paths result in worse sample complexity in terms of the total number of documents per language pair needed.   We believe our theoretical insights and implications contribute to the future algorithmic design of universal machine translation."

Existing methods for this problem are purely likelihood-based, leading to the spurious correlations and hurt the generalization ability when transferred to out-of-domain downstream tasks. By spurious correlation, we mean that the conditional probability of one token  given another one can be high  without robust  relationships between them.

Previous state-of-the-art methods attempt to apply spatio-temporal attention mechanism on video frame features without explicitly modeling the location and relations among object interaction occurred in videos. However, the relations between object interaction and their location information are very critical for both action recognition and question reasoning.  In this work, we propose to represent the contents in the video as a location-aware graph by incorporating the location information of an object into the graph construction.

Based on the constructed graph, we propose to use graph convolution to infer both the category and temporal locations of an action.  		As the graph is built on objects, our method is able to focus on the foreground action contents for better video question answering.

For instance, Nisbett book ""The geography thought: How Asians Westerners think differently... why"" stated East Asians think basis experience dialectically holistically, Westerners think logically, abstractly, analytically . This cultural behavior attitude mostly governed many factors, including socio-economic situation country, faith belief system, lifestyle. In fact, COVID-19 crisis showed greater cultural differences countries seem alike respect language, shared history culture. For example, even though Denmark Sweden two neighboring countries speak almost language share lot culture history, stand extreme ends spectrum comes way reacted coronavirus . Denmark Norway imposed robust lockdown measures closing borders, schools, restaurants, restricting gathering social contact, side, Sweden taken relaxed approach corona outbreak keeping schools, restaurants, borders open. Social media platforms play essential role extreme crisis individuals use communication channels share ideas, opinions, reactions others cope react crises. Therefore, study, focus exploring collective reactions events expressed social media. Particular emphasis given analyzing people's reactions global health-related events especially COVID-19 pandemic expressed Twitter's social media platform widespread popularity ease access using API. To end, tweets collected thousands Twitter users communicated within four weeks corona crisis analyzed understand different cultures reacting responding coronavirus. Additionally, extended version publicly available tweets dataset also used. A new model sentiment emotion analysis proposed. The model takes advantage natural language processing deep neural networks comprises two main stages. The first stage involves sentiment polarity classifier classifies tweets positive negative. The output first stage used input emotion classifier aims assign tweet either one positive emotions classes one negative emotions classes . Figure shows abstract model proposed system sentiment emotion analysis tweets' text. \subsection{Study Objective \& Research Questions} Our primary objective study understand different cultures behave react given global crisis.

Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques three benchmark datasets. , including TGIF-QA, Toutube2Text-QA MSVD-QA."," How different cultures react and respond given a crisis is predominant in a society's norms and political will to combat the situation. Often the decisions made are necessitated by events, social pressure, or the need of the hour, which may not represent the will of the nation. While some are pleased with it, others might show resentment. Coronavirus  brought a mix of similar emotions from the nations towards the decisions taken by their respective governments. Social media was bombarded with posts containing both positive and negative sentiments on the COVID-19, pandemic, lockdown, hashtags past couple of months. Despite geographically close, many neighboring countries reacted differently to one another. For instance, Denmark and Sweden, which share many similarities, stood poles apart on the decision taken by their respective governments. Yet, their nation's support was mostly unanimous, unlike the South Asian neighboring countries where people showed a lot of anxiety and resentment. This study tends to detect and analyze sentiment polarity and emotions demonstrated during the initial phase of the pandemic and the lockdown period employing natural language processing  and deep learning techniques on Twitter posts. Deep long short-term memory  models used for estimating the sentiment polarity and emotions from extracted tweets have been trained to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the sentiment140 dataset. The use of emoticons showed a unique and novel way of validating the supervised deep learning models on tweets extracted from Twitter."

There many reasons reducing size models important, real-time inference efficiency deployment mobile devices. Transferring knowledge large, powerful models compact models proven practical solution. Clearly, knowledge transfer agents tasks important component towards AGI. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% What knowledge transfer? In general, regarded learning process learners acquire new modify existing knowledge interacting teachers. If represent knowledge probabilistic distribution, e.g., \nonumber \end{align} Thus, learning means get closer , distributions learner teacher. It's natural relate knowledge transfer KL-divergence measures much information lost approximating distribution another. Existing approaches categorized minimizing KL-divergence order. Learners infinite capacity would end behaving exact way teachers. In case, order matter. Unfortunately, true. In practice, learners typically restricted simple function family, e.g., Gaussian, parameterized neural networks finite layers hidden units. Meanwhile, teachers perfect. noisy especially high-dimensional action space. The question order performs better? Previous works attempt analyze difference restricting Gaussian distributions. However, learning process, i.e., learner interact teacher acquires knowledge, totally unclear. In paper, reinterpret KL-divergence minimization knowledge transfer provide in-depth analysis way learner acquires knowledge teacher, without applying constraints distributions. At high level, noticed encourages learners exposed distributions reinforced on-policy learning. Thus, propose minimize solving sequential decision making problems. To verify hypothesis, revisit Knowledge Distillation attempts distill knowledge teacher learner minimizing Neural Machine Translation task. The goal task generate sequence tokens target language given sentence source language. The generation procedure is: position , given previous actions , try produce token expected give maximum reward . Basically, NMT solve sequential decision making problem high-dimensional, discrete action space. Exposure bias known important issue due lacking exploration. We simply replace call approach Knowledge Acquisition . We describe learning process dialog, shown Fig..

Initial tweets right pandemic outbreak extracted tracking trending hasthtags\# February 2020. The study also utilized publicly available Kaggle tweet dataset March - April 2020. Tweets six neighboring countries analyzed, employing NLP-based sentiment analysis techniques. The paper also presents unique way validating proposed model's performance via emoticons extracted users' tweets. We cross-checked detected sentiment polarity emotions via various published sources number positive cases reported respective health ministries published statistics. Our findings showed high correlation tweets' polarity originating USA Canada, Pakistan India. Whereas, despite many cultural similarities, tweets posted following corona outbreak two Nordic countries, i.e., Sweden Norway, showed quite opposite polarity trend. Although joy fear dominated two countries, positive polarity dropped average Norway much earlier Swedes. This may due lockdown imposed Norway good month half Government decided ease restrictions, whereas, Swedish Government went herd immunity, equally supported Swedes. Nevertheless, average number positive tweets higher average number negative tweets Norway. The trend observed Pakistan Canada, positive tweets negative ones. We observed number negative positive tweets started dropping average sentiments first second week April six countries. This study also suggests NLP-based sentiment emotion detection help identify cross-cultural trends also plausible link actual events users' emotions expressed social platforms high certitude, despite socio-economic cultural differences, high correlation sentiments expressed given global crisis - case coronavirus pandemic.

Moreover, advanced seq2seq type language models word embedding explored future work. Till date , pandemic still rising parts world, including Brazil Russia. It would interesting observe extended patterns tweets across countries detect assert people's behavior dealing calamities. We hope believe study provide new perspective readers scientific community interested exploring cultural similarities differences public opinions given crisis, could influence decision makers transforming developing efficient policies better tackle situation, safe-guarding people's interest needs society. {}"," Knowledge Transfer has been applied in solving a wide variety of problems. For example, knowledge can be transferred between tasks  or between agents . Without loss of generality, we relate knowledge transfer to KL-divergence minimization, i.e., matching the  distributions of learners and teachers. The equivalence gives us a new perspective in understanding variants of the KL-divergence by looking at how learners structure their interaction with teachers in order to acquire knowledge.  In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of KL-divergence minimization in \texttt{Forward} and \texttt{Backward} orders, which shows that learners are reinforced via on-policy learning in \texttt{Backward}. In contrast, learners are supervised in \texttt{Forward}. Moreover, our analysis is gradient-based, so it can be generalized to arbitrary tasks and help to decide which order to minimize given the property of the task. By replacing \texttt{Forward} with \texttt{Backward} in Knowledge Distillation, we observed +0.7-1.1 BLEU gains on the WMT'17 De-En and IWSLT'15 Th-En machine translation tasks."

In this paper, we perform an empirical study of a Chinese historical text, Records of the Three Kingdoms , and a historical novel of the same story, Romance of the Three Kingdoms . We employ natural language processing techniques to extract characters and their relationships. Then, we characterize the social networks and sentiments of the main characters in the historical text and the historical novel. We find that the social network in Romance is more complex and dynamic than that of Records, and the influence of the main characters differs. These findings shed light on the different styles of storytelling in the two literary genres and how the historical novel complicates the social networks of characters to enrich the literariness of the story."
"As unsupervised approach, topic modelling enjoyed great success automatic text analysis. In general, topic model aims discover set latent topics collection documents, describes interpretable semantic concept. Topic models like Latent Dirichlet Allocation ~ hierarchical/Bayesian extensions, e.g., in~\citet{blei2010nested,paisley2015nested,gan2015learning,zhou2016augmentable} achieved impressive performance document analysis. Recently, developments Variational AutoEncoders Autoencoding Variational Inference ~ facilitated proposal Neural Topic Models in~\citet{miao2016neural,srivastava2017autoencoding,krishnan2018challenges,burkhardt2019decoupling}. Inspired VAE, many NTMs use encoder takes Bag-of-Words representation document input approximates posterior distribution latent topics. The posterior samples input decoder reconstruct BoW representation. Compared conventional topic models, NTMs usually enjoy better flexibility scalability, important applications large-scale data. Despite promising performance recent popularity, several shortcomings existing NTMs, could hinder usefulness extensions. i) The training inference processes NTMs typically complex due prior posterior constructions latent topics. To encourage topic sparsity smoothness, Dirichlet~ gamma~ distributions usually used prior posterior topics, reparameterisation inapplicable them, thus, complex sampling schemes approximations used, could limit model flexibility. ii) A desideratum topic model generate better topical representations documents coherent diverse topics; many existing NTMs, hard achieve good document representation coherent/diverse topics time. This objective NTMs achieve lower reconstruction error, usually means topics less coherent diverse, observed analysed in~. iii) It well-known topic models degrade performance severely short documents tweets, news headlines product reviews, individual document contains insufficient word co-occurrence information. This issue exacerbated NTMs use encoder decoder networks, vulnerable data sparsity. To address shortcomings NTMs, paper propose neural topic model, built upon novel Optimal Transport framework derived new view topic modelling. For document, consider content encoded two representations: observed representation, , distribution words vocabulary latent representation, , distribution topics. obtained normalising document's word count vector needs learned model. For document collection, vocabulary size large one individual document usually consists tiny subset words. Therefore, sparse low-level representation semantic information document. As number topics much smaller vocabulary size, relatively dense high-level representation content. Therefore, learning topic model viewed process learning distribution close distribution possible. Accordingly, crucial investigate measure distance two distributions different supports. As optimal transport powerful tool measuring distance travelled transporting mass one distribution match another given specific cost function, recent development computational OT shown promising feasibility efficiently compute OT large-scale problems, natural us develop new NTM based minimisation OT. Specifically, model leverages encoder outputs topic distribution document taking word count vector input like standard NTMs, minimise OT distance , two discrete distributions support words topics, respectively. Notably, cost function OT distance specifies weights topics words, define distance embedding space, embed topics words represent semantics. By leveraging pretrained word embeddings, cost function function topic embeddings, learned jointly encoder. With advanced properties OT modelling geometric structures spaces probability distributions, model able achieve better balance obtaining good document representation generating coherent/diverse topics. In addition, model eases burden designing complex sampling schemes posterior NTMs. More interestingly, model natural way incorporating pretrained word embeddings, demonstrated able alleviate issue insufficient word co-occurrence information short texts~. With extensive experiments, model shown enjoy state-of-the-art performance terms topic quality document representations regular short texts. In work, proposed multitask learning-based approach predict depressed users Sina Weibo. First, based data collection script filtering manual labeling, built publish large Weibo User depression detection dataset - WU3D. The total number user samples reaches 30,000 user enriched information fields. This dataset quite sufficient used subsequent researchers complete research. Secondly, summarized manually extracted ten statistical features including text, social behavior, picture-based features. The experimental results showed varying degrees distribution differences normal users depressed users, contribute positively classification tasks. Our experimental results also proved feature engineering process text information vital part depression detection OSN. Furthermore, evaluated performance pretrained model XLNet embedding model solve downstream classification tasks. It showed appropriate embedding length selected, XLNet excellent performance efficiency handling long text sequences. Finally, implemented multitask learning DNN classifier, FusionNet, simultaneously handle word vector classification task statistical feature classification task. Benefit strategic advantages multitask learning, FusionNet reduced loss feature information caused transfer learning. Compared commonly used models existing work, FusionNet achieved significant performance improvement F1-Score 0.9772 showed best classification robustness training samples unbalanced. Thus, proven ideal classification model dealing multiple classification tasks time. For future work, two directions explored. The size dataset expanded. Larger datasets constructed training evaluating classifiers achieve better generalization performance. The characteristics behavior patterns depressed users analyzed. We propose effective feature solutions user-level depression detection OSN. Bibliography"," Recently, Neural Topic Models  inspired by variational autoencoders have obtained increasingly research interest due to their promising results on text analysis. However, it is usually hard for existing NTMs to achieve good document representation and coherent/diverse topics at the same time. Moreover, they often degrade their performance severely on short documents. The requirement of reparameterisation could also comprise their training quality and model flexibility. To address these shortcomings, we present a new neural topic model via the theory of optimal transport . Specifically, we propose to learn the topic distribution of a document by directly minimising its OT distance to the document's word distributions. Importantly, the cost matrix of the OT distance models the weights between topics and words, which is constructed by the distances between topics and words in an embedding space. Our proposed model can be trained efficiently with a differentiable loss. Extensive experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art NTMs on discovering more coherent and diverse topics and deriving better document representations for both regular and short texts."

This leaves many questions unanswered or inadequately answered. Many of these questions are not unique, and reliable identification of similar questions would enable more efficient and effective question answering schema. COVID-19 has only exacerbated this problem. Almost every government agency and healthcare organization has tried to meet the informational need of users by building online FAQs, but there is no way for people to ask their question and know if it is answered on one of these pages. While many research efforts have focused on the problem of general question similarity, these approaches do not generalize well to domains that require expert knowledge to determine semantic similarity, such as the medical domain. In this paper, we show how a double fine-tuning approach of pretraining a neural network on medical question-answer pairs followed by fine-tuning on medical question-question pairs is a particularly useful intermediate task for the ultimate goal of determining medical question similarity. While other pretraining tasks yield an accuracy below 78.7\% on this task, our model achieves an accuracy of 82.6\% with the same number of training examples, an accuracy of 80.0\% with a much smaller training set, and an accuracy of 84.5\% when the full corpus of medical question-answer data is used.

To leverage this problem, we focus on the knowledge transfer of the inner structural relationships between each classes. A label embedding with relational teacher student learning approach is proposed. Embedded labels are learned from the source domain data, which encodes the structural relationships. Then a relational teacher student learning framework is used to transfer knowledge. Our proposed approach is evaluated on DCASE2018 task1b data set. And the experimental and visualized results successfully verify our augment and proposed method, which significantly improve the classification accuracy on target device data, with the knowledge transferred from the source device data.  %  Alternative 1: %In this work, we use a model adaptation approach based on  neural label embedding  and  knowledge distillation to combat the accuracy drop in acoustic scene classification with deep neural networks caused by a mismatch between  development  and production  audio recording devices. The proposed adaptation approach works with unpaired source-target data and leverages upon NLE designed to take into account the relationships among acoustic scene classes. The NLE thereby not only condenses a representation of the DNN output distribution given all audio recordings aligned with the same output class but also captures the inherent relationships among acoustic scene classes. Device adaptation is carried out using relational teacher-student learning  solely based on target data, target labels, source DNN, and NLE. The latter serve as soft targets for DNN adaptation.  The proposed approach is assessed against the DCASE 2018 task1b dataset. Experimental evidence confirm the effectiveness our our approach, which compares favourably to conventional device adaptation, and traditional teacher-student based adaptation. Moreover, we observe that NLE based on structural information lead to superior ASC  results than NLE obtained with symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence ,which do not take into account the relationships among acoustic scene classes.  % Alternative 2 In this paper, we propose a domain adaptation framework to address the device mismatch issue in acoustic scene classification leveraging upon neural label embedding  and relational teacher student learning .  Taking into account the structural relationships between acoustic scene classes, our proposed framework captures such relationships which are intrinsically device-independent. In the training stage, transferable knowledge is condensed in NLE from the source domain. Next in the adaptation stage, a novel RTSL strategy is adopted to learn adapted target models without using paired source-target data often required in conventional teacher student learning. The proposed framework is evaluated on the DCASE 2018 Task1b data set. Experimental results based on AlexNet-L deep classification models confirm the effectiveness of our proposed approach for mismatch situations. %when training with Device A data and testing with data recorded with Devices B and C.  NLE-alone adaptation compares favourably with the conventional device adaptation and teacher student based adaptation techniques. NLE with RTSL further improves the classification accuracy."

Conventional approaches in speech processing typically use forced alignment to encoder per frame acoustic features to word level features and perform multimodal fusion of the resulting acoustic and lexical representations. As an alternative, we explore attention based multimodal fusion and compare its performance with forced alignment based fusion. Experiments conducted on the Fisher corpus show that our proposed approach achieves $\sim$6-9\% and $\sim$3-4\% absolute improvement  over the baseline BLSTM model on reference transcripts and ASR outputs respectively. We further improve the model robustness to ASR errors by performing data augmentation with N-best lists which achieves up to an additional $\sim$2-6\% improvement on ASR outputs. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of semi-supervised learning approach by performing ablation study on various sizes of the corpus. When trained on 1 hour of speech and text data, the proposed model achieved $\sim$9-18\% absolute improvement over baseline model.   %We also incorporate a pretrained lexical BERT encoder to further enhance the hidden representation of acoustic embedding when performed fusion with lexical embedding."

Our model is based on Tacotron~2 with a fully convolutional input text encoder whose weights are predicted by a separate parameter generator network. To boost voice cloning, the model uses an adversarial speaker classifier with a gradient reversal layer that removes speaker-specific information from the encoder.

"Peking Opera, also known Beijing Opera Jingju, Chinese traditional performing art combines music, vocal performance, mime, dance acrobatics. Singing Peking Opera various styles, widely different depending different role type music styles. Strong personal styles also make actual singing different given music notes. Like dialect Mandarin, even unique way pronunciation. Moreover, melody singing often consist arias variation complex transitory vibratos, makes singing expressive difficult learn. Another difference normal singing note length great variance, sometime long note appear . All factors makes challenging modelling generating Peking Opera singing comparing normal singing. Although works focusing synthesis Peking Opera, broadly, opera, synthesis singing voice researched since 1962 Kelly Lochbaum used acoustic tube model synthesis singing voice success. Recently, several works use deep neural networks synthesis singing voice which, known parametric systems, process fundamental frequency harmonics features separately. As typical case among systems, Neural Parametric Singing Synthesizer using phoneme timing model, pitch model timbre model consist set neural networks generate acoustic parameters singing. In NPSS, Fitting Heuristic method introduced eliminate mismatch music note duration predicted phoneme duration. However, Fitting Heuristic method totally rule based requires locate principal vowel adjusting phoneme duration. This maybe acceptable English Japanese singing cases, cause huge duration error synthesizing Peking Opera. Different normal speech singing, Peking Opera, one syllable last long time contains long sequence phonemes, e.g. ``l-j-E-a-a-N"". More importantly, one can't simply tell phoneme amongst phonemes principle phone. There could multiple equally important phonemes Peking Opera singing. To better synthesize expressive Peking Opera, paper proposes Peking Opera singing synthesis system based Duration Informed Attention Network . The main contribution study lies two following points: 1) To tackle rhythm mismatch music note duration predicted phoneme duration, contextual based mixture density networks followed Lagrange Multiplier optimization proposed implemented duration modelling. This method completely data-driven, importantly, skips step locating principle phoneme conventional Fitting Heuristic method. 2) To deal melody mismatch original music score actual singing, also better model expressive variations vibratos Peking Opera, pseudo music score generated real singing fed input DurIAN model training.

A Peking Opera singer usually exhibits a very strong personal style via introducing improvisation and expressiveness on stage which leads the actual rhythm and pitch contour to deviate significantly from the original music score. This inconsistency poses a great challenge in Peking Opera singing voice synthesis from a music score. In this work, we propose to deal with this issue and synthesize expressive Peking Opera singing from the music score based on the Duration Informed Attention Network  framework. To tackle the rhythm mismatch, Lagrange multiplier is used to find the optimal output phoneme duration sequence with the constraint of the given note duration from music score. As for the pitch contour mismatch, instead of directly inferring from music score, we adopt a pseudo music score generated from the real singing and feed it as input during training. The experiments demonstrate that with the proposed system we can synthesize Peking Opera singing voice with high-quality timbre, pitch and expressiveness."
"Many machine learning datasets label imbalance dataset bias problem. In many cases, either data harder collect certain classes data collection phase biased bias introduced collected dataset.

We aware one study performs F-measure optimization convolutional neural networks, again, using system generates several binary classification outputs parallel; scenario, F-measure optimization reduces task tuning thresholds individual binary classifiers order maximize weighted log likelihood. However, true multi-class classification, using softmax output neural network, requires modified definition F-measure. There threshold tuned; instead, F-measure optimization requires optimizing model generate `better' scores terms F-measure. Model versus threshold optimization fundamental difference study previous ones. In work, goal design loss function maximize F-measure instead accuracy DNNs. Our methods tested two standard socioeconomic classification problems literature fairness , two SLU tasks .

However, the rendering of prosody in the synthesized speech remains to be improved, especially for long sentences, where prosodic phrasing errors can occur frequently. In this paper, we extend the Tacotron-based speech synthesis framework to explicitly model the prosodic phrase breaks. We propose a multi-task learning scheme for Tacotron training, that optimizes the system to predict both Mel spectrum and phrase breaks.  To our best knowledge, this is the first implementation of multi-task learning for Tacotron based TTS with a prosodic phrasing model. Experiments show that our proposed training scheme consistently improves the voice quality for both Chinese and Mongolian systems."

In this paper, a prosody learning    mechanism is proposed to model the prosody of speech based    on TTS system, where the prosody information of speech is    extracted from the mel-spectrum by a prosody learner and    combined with the phoneme sequence to reconstruct the    mel-spectrum. Meanwhile, the sematic features of text from    the pre-trained language model is introduced to improve the    prosody prediction results. In addition, a novel self-attention    structure, named as local attention, is proposed to lift    this restriction of input text length, where the relative    position information of the sequence is modeled by the    relative position matrices so that the position encodings    is no longer needed. Experiments on English and Mandarin show    that speech with more satisfactory prosody has obtained    in our model. Especially in Mandarin synthesis,    our proposed model outperforms baseline model with a MOS gap    of 0.08, and the overall naturalness of the synthesized    speech has been significantly improved."

However, the increased complexity of a model can also introduce high risk of over-fitting, which is a major challenge in SLU tasks due to the limitation of available data. In this paper, we propose an attention-based SLU model together with three encoder enhancement strategies to overcome data sparsity challenge. The first strategy focuses on the transfer-learning approach to improve feature extraction capability of the encoder. It is implemented by pre-training the encoder component with a quantity of Automatic Speech Recognition annotated data relying on the standard Transformer architecture and then fine-tuning the SLU model with a small amount of target labelled data. The second strategy adopts multi-task learning strategy, the SLU model integrates the speech recognition model by sharing the same underlying encoder, such that improving robustness and generalization ability. The third strategy, learning from Component Fusion  idea, involves a Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformer  model and aims to boost the capability of the decoder with an auxiliary network. It hence reduces the risk of over-fitting and augments the ability of the underlying encoder, indirectly. Experiments on the FluentAI dataset show that cross-language transfer learning and multi-task strategies have been improved by up to $4.52\%$ and $3.89\%$ respectively, compared to the baseline."
"Associative memory defined psychology ability remember many sets, called memories, unrelated items. Prompted large enough subset items taken one memory, animal computer associative memory retrieve rest items belonging memory. The diverse human cognitive abilities involve making appropriate responses stimulus patterns often understood operation associative memory, ``memories'' often distillations consolidations multiple experiences rather merely corresponding single event. The intuitive idea associative memory described using ``feature space''. In mathematical model abstracted neurobiology, presence particular feature denoted activity model neuron due directly driven feature signal. If possible features, distinct connections neural circuit involving neurons. Typical cortical synapses highly reliable, store bits information\footnote{For instance, recent study reports information content individual synapses ranging bits, based electron microscopy imaging, see also . These numbers refer structural accuracy synapses. There also electrical chemical noise synaptic currents induced biophysical details vesicle release neurotransmitter binding. The unreliability fusion pre-synaptic vesicles pre-synaptic neuron membrane dominant source trial-to-trial synaptic current variation . This noise decreases electrical information capacity individual synapses maximal value synaptic structure would otherwise provide.}. The description particular memory requires roughly bits information. Such system therefore store unrelated memories. Simple artificial neural network models associative memory exhibit limitation even precise synapses, limits memory storage less memories . Situations arise number small desired number memories far exceeds , see examples biological AI systems Section . In situations associative memory model would insufficient, since would able memorize required number patterns. At time, models associative memory large storage capacity considered paper, easily solve problems. The starting point paper machine learning approach associative memory based energy function attractor dynamics space variables, called Dense Associative Memory . This idea shown dramatically increase memory storage capacity corresponding neural network proposed useful increasing robustness neural networks adversarial attacks . Recently, extension idea continuous variables, called modern Hopfield network, demonstrated remarkably successful results immune repertoire classification , provided valuable insights properties attention heads Transformer architectures . Dense Associative Memories modern Hopfield networks, however, cannot describe biological neural networks terms true microscopic degrees freedom, since contain many-body interaction terms equations describing dynamics corresponding energy functions. To illustrate point consider two networks: conventional Hopfield network Dense Associative Memory cubic interaction term energy function . In conventional network dynamics encoded matrix , represents strengths synaptic connections feature neurons . Thus, network manifestly describable terms two-body synapses, approximately true many biological synapses. In contrast, Dense Associative Memory network cubic energy function naively requires synaptic connections tensors three indices, harder, although impossible, implement biologically. Many-body synapses become even problematic situations interaction term described complicated function simple power . Many-body synapses typically appear situations one starts microscopic theory described two-body synapses integrates degrees freedom . The argument described based counting information stored synapses conjunction fact modern Hopfield nets Dense Associative Memories huge storage capacity hints solution. The reason networks storage capacity much greater describe dynamics neurons, rather involve additional neurons synapses. Thus, remains theoretical question: hidden circuitry look like? Is possible introduce set hidden neurons appropriately chosen interaction terms activation functions resulting theory large memory storage capacity , and, time, manifestly describable terms two-body synapses? The main contributions current paper following. First, extend model continuous state variables continuous time, state network described system non-linear differential equations. Second, couple additional set ``complex neurons'' ``memory neurons'' hidden neurons feature neurons. When synaptic couplings neuron activation functions appropriately chosen, dynamical system variables energy function describing dynamics. The minima dynamics locations - dimensional feature subspace minima corresponding Dense Associative Memory system. Importantly, resulting dynamical system mathematical structure conventional recurrent neural network, neurons interact pairs two-body matrix synaptic connections. We study three limiting cases new theory, call models A, B, C. In one limit reduces Dense Associative Memory model depending choice activation function. In another limit model reduces network . Finally, present third limit call Spherical Memory model. To best knowledge model studied literature. However, high degree symmetry reason might useful future explorations various models large associative memory recurrent neural networks machine learning. For purposes paper defined ``biological plausiblity'' absence many-body synapses. It important note aspects model described equations biologically implausible. For instance, assumes strengths two physically different synapses equal. This assumption necessary existence energy function, makes easy prove convergence fixed point. It relaxed equations , makes even biological, but, time, difficult analyse. In paper, proposed various audio dequantization schemes implemented flow-based neural vocoder. For uniform dequantization, compressed range audio domain match conventional uniform dequantization method using mu-law companding compression. In addition, implemented iw dequantization resolve noise issue occurs lossy compression. For Gaussian dequantization, applied hyperbolic tangent normalization data-oriented Gaussian noise properly fit data within audio range. Lastly, modified flow block flow-based neural vocoder construct variational dequantization model apply flexible noise. From experiments, demonstrate implementing audio dequantization supplement flow-based neural vocoder produce better audio quality fewer artifacts. \clearpage","  Dense Associative Memories or modern Hopfield networks permit storage and reliable  retrieval of an exponentially large  number of memories. At the same time, their naive implementation is non-biological, since it seemingly requires the existence of many-body synaptic junctions between the neurons.   We show that these models are effective descriptions of a more microscopic  theory that has additional  neurons and only requires two-body interactions between them. For this reason our proposed microscopic theory is a valid model of large associative memory with a degree of biological plausibility. The dynamics of our network and its reduced dimensional equivalent both minimize energy  functions. When certain dynamical variables  are integrated out from our microscopic theory, one can recover many of the models that were previously discussed in the literature, e.g. the model presented in ``Hopfield Networks is All You Need'' paper. We also provide an alternative derivation of the energy function and the update rule proposed in the aforementioned paper and clarify the relationships between various models of this class."

However, these models typically require large amounts of training data, which can make it costly to produce a new voice with the desired quality. Although multi-speaker modeling can reduce the data requirements necessary for a new voice, this approach is usually not viable for many low-resource languages for which abundant multi-speaker data is not available. In this paper, we therefore investigated to what extent multilingual multi-speaker modeling can be an alternative to monolingual multi-speaker modeling, and explored how data from foreign languages may best be combined with low-resource language data. We found that multilingual modeling can increase the naturalness of low-resource language speech, showed that multilingual models can produce speech with a naturalness comparable to monolingual multi-speaker models, and saw that the target language naturalness was affected by the strategy used to add foreign language data."

The standard sequence steps traditional Entity Linking system follows: The system tries identify Tesla span interest. This task called Mention Detection Span Detection. Then attempt made link appropriate entity Knowledge Base. In work focus Knowledge Bases form graphs, hence entity linker case tries link Tesla appropriate node graph. For human, evident question looking person's name created organisation named Tesla, since text contains relation . Hence, important entity linker understands nuance ignores entity nodes Knowledge Graph also contain Tesla labels, e.g., considering example Wikidata knowledge graph. The task ignoring wrong candidate nodes, identifying right candidate node instead, called Entity Disambiguation . The cumulative process involving Mention Detection Entity Disambiguation called Entity Linking . Typically, MD ED stages implemented different machine learning models require separate training. Especially MD part, sentences marked entity spans requirement. In practice, data easily available. Moreover, errors introduced MD phase cascade ED phase. Hence, movement towards end-to-end Entity Linkers began . Such systems require labelled entity spans training. In spite benefits end-to-end models challenges remain: Due lack span detector initial phase, word sentence needs considered entity candidate disambiguation leads generation much larger number entity candidates. To re-rank candidates large amount time consumed, processing features candidates, also compiling features. %Some systems fetch neighbouring entities relations fly candidate entity, step take minute certain entities large KGs.

In such a pipeline, Entity Linking  is often the first step. Several EL models first perform span detection and then entity disambiguation. In such models errors from the span detection phase cascade to later steps and result in a drop of overall accuracy. Moreover, lack of gold entity spans in training data is a limiting factor for span detector training. Hence the movement towards end-to-end EL models began where no separate span detection step is involved. In this work we present a novel approach to end-to-end EL by applying the popular Pointer Network model, which achieves competitive performance. We demonstrate this in our evaluation over three datasets on the Wikidata Knowledge Graph.    \keywords{Entity Linking  \and Question Answering \and Knowledge Graphs \and Wikidata}"

However, the inherently unsupervised nature of social media platforms has also made it easier to spread false information and fake news. Furthermore, the high volume and velocity of information flow in such platforms make manual supervision and control of information propagation infeasible. This paper aims to address this issue by proposing a novel deep learning approach for automated detection of false short-text claims on social media. We first introduce Sentimental LIAR, which extends the LIAR dataset of short claims by adding features based on sentiment and emotion analysis of claims. Furthermore, we propose a novel deep learning architecture based on the BERT-Base language model for classification of claims as genuine or fake. Our results demonstrate that the proposed architecture trained on Sentimental LIAR can achieve an accuracy of 70\%, which is an improvement of ~30\% over previously reported results for the LIAR benchmark. %improve the previously reported accuracy of the task by     Focusing on the prevalent short-text format of claims on social media such as Twitter, our work   to an unprecedented challenge in  . Fake news is not only threatening to undermine democracy but equally has been proven to cause violence, disruption, and chaos in the world. Hence, in this research paper, we are going to use the machine learning approach to classify the fake news from the true ones. The rise of Natural Language Processing makes it possible to analyze the news articles. We are proposing a model composed of three perspectives. The first perspective is the Style Based Classification where we classify the article based on its intention is misleading or not, by analyzing the text pattern from the attribute-based and structure-based language features. The second perspective is Knowledge-based classification which is going to classify the news articles based on its authenticity by knowledge extraction and fact-checking. The third perspective is the Propagation and Credibility based classification by analyzing the propagation model of fake news and the credibility of the engaging users. This research paper currently focused on first perspective i.e. Style based classification by deception detection using deep neural networks where we performed experiments using LIAR Dataset by changing it into binary labels and BERT-Base."

In this paper, we propose a     simple chart-based neural discourse parser that does not     require any manually-crafted features and is based on     learned span representations only. To overcome the     computational challenge, we propose an independence     assumption between the label assigned to a node in the     tree and the splitting point that separates its children,     which results in tractable decoding.

For example, summarization models are often trained to predict human reference summaries and evaluated using ROUGE, but both of these metrics are rough proxies for what we really care about---summary quality. In this work, we show that it is possible to significantly improve summary quality by training a model to optimize for human preferences.  We collect a large, high-quality dataset of human comparisons between summaries, train a model to predict the human-preferred summary, and use that model as a reward function to fine-tune a summarization policy using reinforcement learning. We apply our method to a version of the TL;DR dataset of Reddit posts \cite{volske2017tl} and find that our models significantly outperform both human reference summaries and much larger models fine-tuned with supervised learning alone. Our models also transfer to CNN/DM news articles \cite{hermann2015teaching}, producing summaries nearly as good as the human reference without any news-specific fine-tuning.\footnote{Samples from all of our models can be viewed \href{https://openaipublic.blob.core.windows.net/summarize-from-feedback/website/index.html}{on our website}.}    We conduct extensive analyses to understand our human feedback dataset and fine-tuned models.\footnote{We provide inference code for our 1.3B models and baselines, as well as a model card and our human feedback dataset with over 64k summary comparisons,  \href{https://github.com/openai/summarize-from-feedback}{here}.}   We establish that our reward model generalizes to new datasets, and that optimizing our reward model results in better summaries than optimizing ROUGE according to humans.

Here, we show that an agent situated in a simulated 3D world, and endowed with a novel dual-coding external memory, can exhibit similar one-shot word learning when trained with conventional RL algorithms. After a single introduction to a novel object via visual perception and language , the agent can manipulate the object as instructed , combining short-term, within-episode knowledge of the nonsense word with long-term lexical and motor knowledge. We find that, under certain training conditions and with a particular memory writing mechanism, the agent's one-shot word-object binding generalizes to novel exemplars within the same ShapeNet category, and is effective in settings with unfamiliar numbers of objects. We further show how dual-coding memory can be exploited as a signal for intrinsic motivation, stimulating the agent to seek names for objects that may be useful later. Together, the results demonstrate that deep neural networks can exploit meta-learning, episodic memory and an explicitly multi-modal environment to account for fast-mapping, a fundamental pillar of human cognitive development and a potentially transformative capacity for artificial agents."

Several prior works have suggested that either complex pretraining schemes using unsupervised methods such as language modeling or complicated models are necessary to achieve a high classification accuracy. However, we develop a training strategy that allows even a simple BiLSTM model, when trained with cross-entropy loss, to achieve competitive results compared with more complex approaches. Furthermore, in addition to cross-entropy loss, by using a combination of entropy minimization, adversarial, and virtual adversarial losses for both labeled and unlabeled data, we report state-of-the-art results for text classification task on several benchmark datasets.

"Coreference resolution aims identifying expressions refer entity text. It helps derive correct interpretation text binding antecedents pronouns together recognizing syntactic relationship among them. The coreference resolution considered critical preprocessing step various high-level natural language processing tasks including document summarization, question answering, information extraction . Existing coreference resolution approaches divided two major categories: mention-pair models entity-mention models . One main shortcomings mention-pair model making coreference decision without entity-level information. Moreover, lack information preceding clusters may result contradictory links. The entity-mention model tries make use non-local information encouraging sharing features across mentions point real-world entity. However, coreferent mentions usually spread far apart text, makes extremely difficult define effective global features. Previous studies either count long-term memory variants implicitly capture global features seek incorporate features clusters already formed determine whether mention coreferent preceding cluster . The former might miss important features specific pairwise predictions without help explicit entity-level features, latter may suffer error propagation false clusters used create entity-level features making future predictions. Taking text ``On November 3, 1992, Clinton elected 42nd president United States, following year Hillary Clinton became first lady. In 2013, Presidential Medal Freedom."" example, assume three mentions ``Clinton"", ``Hillary Clinton"", ``he"" well identified. The traditional mention-pair model likely group three mentions cluster shown Figure since ``Clinton"" ``Hillary Clinton"" share surname, ``he'' agrees ``Clinton"" gender number. To make use information clusters already formed, recent studies try better represent current mention incorporating features derived preceding cluster probably join . However, methods allow information shared forward fashion, i.e., antecedent expressions postcedent ones, prone reaching results shown Figure . The reason ``Hillary Clinton'' merged ``Clinton'' form cluster, pronoun ``he'' either joins formed cluster begins new one itself. Even though errors might recovered using proper decoding algorithm test time, maximum spanning tree algorithm, similar errors cannot completely eliminated. If information shared iteratively forward backward ways, disagreement gender ``Hillary Clinton'' ``he'' detected representation ``Clinton'' updated two possible co-references, helps find correct result Figure . Recently, graph neural network gained increasing popularity due ability modeling dependencies nodes graph . For coreference resolution, mentions linked via edges modeling likely two linked mentions refer entity. The features nodes shared direction message passing neighborhood aggregation iterative way. We found entity-centric features well captured GNN, achieving close state-of-the-art performance. To avoid contradictory links mention clustering results, propose use variant maximum spanning tree algorithm, second-order decoding algorithm instead traditional greedy search algorithm beam search algorithm . We factorize score tree sum arc-pair scores. A pair arcs link three different mentions, connected mentions viewed small cluster. Our global inference algorithm second-order features helps define powerful entity-level features clusters mentions aggregating scores small clusters. Traditional coreference resolution methods usually include three successive steps: mention detection, candidate pair generation, mention clustering . However, recent studies show joint solutions usually lead improved performance pipelined systems avoiding error propagation. We follow line research formulate coreference resolution joint manner. Our contributions summarized follows: graph neural networks introduced perform coreference resolution, aims better leverage entity-centric information encouraging sharing features across mentions refer entity; global inference algorithm second-order features presented optimally cluster mentions consistent groups; show GNN-based method combing second-order decoding algorithm achieved close state-of-the-art performance CoNLL-2012 coreference resolution benchmark. We show simple BiLSTM model using maximum likelihood training result competitive performance text classification tasks without need additional pretraining step. Also, addition maximum likelihood, using combination entropy minimization, adversarial, virtual adversarial training, report state-of-the-art results several text classification datasets. This mixed objective function also generalizes well tasks relation extraction outperforms current best models. \small"," One of the major challenges in coreference resolution is how to make use of entity-level features defined over clusters of mentions rather than mention pairs. However, coreferent mentions usually spread far apart in an entire text, which makes it extremely difficult to incorporate entity-level features. We propose a graph neural network-based coreference resolution method that can capture the entity-centric information by encouraging the sharing of features across all mentions that probably refer to the same real-world entity. Mentions are linked to each other via the edges modeling how likely two linked mentions point to the same entity.  Modeling by such graphs, the features between mentions can be shared by message passing operations in an entity-centric manner. A global inference algorithm up to second-order features is also presented to optimally cluster mentions into consistent groups. Experimental results show our graph neural network-based method combing with the second-order decoding algorithm  achieved close to state-of-the-art performance on the English CoNLL-2012 Shared Task dataset."
"Encoding linguistic units words, phrases sentences low-dimensional vectors core preliminary task deep learning natural language.

Thus this work introduces and explores the universal representation learning, i.e.,  embeddings of different levels of linguistic unit in a uniform vector space through a task-independent evaluation. We present our approach of constructing analogy datasets in terms of words, phrases and sentences and experiment with multiple representation models to examine geometric properties of the learned vector space. Then we empirically verify that well pre-trained Transformer models incorporated with appropriate training settings may effectively yield universal representation. Especially, our implementation of fine-tuning ALBERT on NLI and PPDB datasets achieves the highest accuracy on analogy tasks in different language levels. Further experiments on the insurance FAQ task show effectiveness of universal representation models in real-world applications."

"Semantic role labeling , namely semantic parsing, shallow semantic parsing task aims recognize predicate-argument structure predicate sentence, whom, when, etc. Specifically, SRL seeks identify arguments label semantic roles given predicate. SRL important method obtaining semantic information beneficial wide range natural language processing tasks, including machine translation, question answering, discourse relation sense classification relation extraction. SRL split four subtasks: predicate detection, predicate disambiguation, argument identification, argument classification. For argument annotation, two formulizations . One based constituents , based dependencies. The other, proposed CoNLL-2008 shared task, also called semantic dependency parsing annotates heads arguments rather phrasal arguments. Figure shows example annotations. In prior SRL work, considerable attention paid feature engineering, struggles capture sufficient discriminative information compared neural network models, capable extracting features automatically. In particular, syntactic information, including syntactic tree features, known extremely beneficial SRL since large scale empirical verification of~\citet{punyakanok-etal-2008-importance}. Despite success, work suffered erroneous syntactic input, leading unsatisfactory performance. To alleviate issues, \citet{marcheggiani-etal-2017-simple,he-etal-2017-deep} proposed simple effective neural model SRL without syntactic input. Their work suggested neural SRL rely syntactic features, contradicting belief syntax necessary prerequisite SRL, believed early as~\citet{gildea-palmer-2002-necessity}. This dramatic contradiction motivated us make thorough exploration syntactic contribution SRL. Both span dependency effective formal representations semantics, though unknown form, span dependency, would better convenience effectiveness semantic machine learning later applications long time.

Recent works syntax contributions limited individual models ways syntax utilized. The conclusions drawn syntax roles therefore limitations. In order reduce limitations, explored three typical strong baseline models two categories syntactic utilization methods.

Previous studies in terms of traditional models have shown syntactic information can make remarkable contributions to SRL performance; however, the necessity of syntactic information was challenged by a few recent neural SRL studies that demonstrate impressive performance without syntactic backbones and suggest that syntax information becomes much less important for neural semantic role labeling, especially when paired with recent deep neural network and large-scale pre-trained language models. Despite this notion, the neural SRL field still lacks a systematic and full investigation on the relevance of syntactic information in SRL, for both dependency and both monolingual and multilingual settings.  This paper intends to quantify the importance of syntactic information for neural SRL in the deep learning framework. We introduce three typical SRL frameworks , sequence-based, tree-based, and graph-based, which are accompanied by two categories of exploiting syntactic information: syntax pruning-based and syntax feature-based. Experiments are conducted on the CoNLL-2005, 2009, and 2012 benchmarks for all languages available, and results show that neural SRL models can still benefit from syntactic information under certain conditions. Furthermore, we show the quantitative significance of syntax to neural SRL models together with a thorough empirical survey using existing models."

In summary, contributions three-fold: We perform four generative tests asses learning reduplication deep convolutional networks: test proportion outputs latent codes manipulated marginal values, test interpolating latent variables, test reduplication unobserved data ciwGAN architecture, replication test reduplication unobserved data bare WaveGAN architecture. All four tests suggest deep convolutional networks learn simple identity-based pattern speech called reduplication, i.e.~a process copies phonological material express new meaning. The ciwGAN network learns encode meaningful representation --- presence reduplication latent codes. There near one-to-one correspondence two latent codes reduplication. By interpolating latent codes, cause bare form gradually turn reduplicated form major changes output majority cases. These results close would considered appearance symbolic computation algebraic rules. Additional evidence approximation symbolic computation emerges comes bare GAN replication experiment: substantial drop regression estimates first one two latent variables highest regression estimates, suggesting even without requirement produce informative data, network ``discretizes'' continuous highly variable phonetic feature --- presence reduplication --- uses small subset latent space represent phonetic/phonological property. Encoding identity-based pattern meaningful representation latent space emerges completely unsupervised manner ciwGAN architecture --- requirement Generator output informative data. Reduplicated unreduplicated forms never paired training data. The network fed bare reduplicated forms randomly. This unsupervised training approximates conditions language acquisition: human language learner needs represent reduplication pair bare reduplicated forms raw unlabeled acoustic data . The ciwGAN learns group reduplicated unreduplicated forms assign unique representation process reduplication. In fact, one-hot vector Generator learns associate reduplication training modeled representation unique meaning/function reduplication adds, line approach represent unique semantics one-hot vectors . The dependencies deep neural networks cannot learn ongoing line inquiry. The results computational experiments presented paper suggest Generator network learns extend learned identity-based patterns novel unobserved data. While network trained reduplicated items start [s], able elicit reduplication output following technique proposed . First, identify variables correspond phonetic/phonological representation presence [s], based , proposes setting single variables well training range reveal underlying value latent variable forces desired property output. We thus force [s] reduplication output simultaneously. For example, network outputs [\textipa{s@siju}] force reduplication [s] output; however, never sees [\textipa{s@siju}] training data --- [\textipa{siju}] reduplicated forms, none included [s]. We also excluded reduplicated unreduplicated items contain sequences acoustically similar [s]. This suggests network extends reduplication novel forms even absence acoustically similar reduplication patterns. Thus, experiments confirm network uses individual latent variables represent linguistically meaningful representations . Setting individual variables values well training interval reveals underlying values. By manipulating individual variables, explore representations learned well interactions different variables work . The results study make apparent deep convolutional network capable encoding different phonetic properties individual latent variables, also processes abstract copying reduplication. One advantages probing learning deep convolutional neural networks speech data trained GANs innovative outputs violate training data structured highly informative ways. The innovative output reduplication [s]-initial forms [\textipa{s@siju}] directly paralleled acoustic outputs read L1 speaker American English absent training data. Acoustic analysis shows high degree similarity generated reduplicated forms human recordings, meaning network learns output novel data linguistically interpretable resemble human speech processes even though absent training data. Thus, results experiments implications cognitive models speech acquisition. It appears one processes long held hallmark symbolic computation language, reduplication, emerge deep convolutional network without language-specific components model even trained raw acoustic inputs. The present paper tests simple partial reduplicative pattern CV copied appears base item. This perhaps computationally simplest reduplicative pattern. The world's languages feature large number reduplicative patterns C, CVC, types phonological content copied. Additionally, reduplication precede follow base inserted inside base item. This paper thus also appeal use well-understood identity-based patterns speech various degrees complexity test patterns deep convolutional networks cannot learn self-organization meaningful representations discretization continuous space emerges deep convolutional networks. \subsubsection*{Acknowledgements} This research funded grant new faculty University Washington.

Existing studies focus on building a context-response matching model with various neural architectures or PLMs and typically learning with a single response prediction task. These approaches overlook many potential training signals contained in dialogue data, which might be beneficial for context understanding and produce better features for response prediction.  Besides, the response retrieved from existing dialogue systems supervised by the conventional way still faces some critical challenges, including incoherence and inconsistency. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose learning a context-response matching model with auxiliary self-supervised tasks designed for the dialogue data based on pre-trained language models. Specifically, we introduce four self-supervised tasks including next session prediction, utterance restoration, incoherence detection and consistency discrimination, and jointly train the PLM-based response selection model with these auxiliary tasks in a multi-task manner.   By this means, the auxiliary tasks can guide the learning of the matching model to achieve a better local optimum and select a more proper response. Experiment results on two benchmarks indicate that the proposed auxiliary self-supervised tasks bring significant improvement for multi-turn response selection in retrieval-based dialogues, and our model achieves new state-of-the-art results on both datasets."

"%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Most neural machine translation systems autoregressive, hence decoding latency grows linearly respect length target sentence. For faster generation, several work proposed non-autoregressive models sub-linear decoding latency given sufficient parallel computation~. As challenging precisely model dependencies among tokens without autoregression, many existing non-autoregressive models first generate initial translation iteratively refined yield better output~.

Given a continuous latent variable model for machine translation, we train an inference network to approximate the gradient of the marginal log probability of the target sentence, using only the latent variable as input. This allows us to use gradient-based optimization to find the target sentence at inference time that approximately maximizes its marginal probability. As each refinement step only involves computation in the latent space of low dimensionality , we avoid computational overhead incurred by existing non-autoregressive inference procedures that often refine in token space.

We evaluate our approach on {\wmtende}, {\wmtroen} and {\iwsltdeen}, and observe two advantages over the EM-like inference:  it is computationally efficient, i.e. each refinement step is twice as fast, and  it is more effective, resulting in higher marginal probabilities and BLEU scores with the same number of refinement steps. On {\wmtende}, for instance, our approach is able to decode $6.2$ times faster than the autoregressive model with minimal degradation to translation quality ."

Maximum Likelihood Estimation  objective is widely adopted in existing dialogue model learning. However, models trained with MLE objective function are plagued by the low-diversity issue when it comes to the open-domain conversational setting. Inspired by the observation that humans not only learn from the positive signals but also benefit from correcting behaviors of undesirable actions, in this work, we introduce contrastive learning into dialogue generation, where the model explicitly perceives the difference between the well-chosen positive and negative utterances. Specifically, we employ a pretrained baseline model as a reference. During contrastive learning, the target dialogue model is trained to give higher conditional probabilities for the positive samples, and lower conditional probabilities for those negative samples, compared to the reference model. To manage the multi-mapping relations prevalent in human conversation, we augment contrastive dialogue learning with group-wise dual sampling. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed group-wise contrastive learning framework is suited for training a wide range of neural dialogue generation models with very favorable performance over the baseline training approaches. }"
"Spoken dialogue systems connect users computer applications human-machine conversations. The users achieve goals, finding restaurant, interacting task-oriented SDS multiple dialogue rounds turns. Dialogue state tracking important task SDS key function maintain state system track progress dialogue. In context work, state user's intention interest accumulated conversation history, user's intention interest turn referred turn-level state. %The state immediate state usually expressed terms set slot-value pairs. % For example, state contains two slot-value pairs, . In example, slots, , values. This state expresses system's belief user wants find cheap Italian restaurant. %At turn, system generates action, expressed user sentences natural language, user responds sentences, referred utterance. The system updates state. The problem dialogue state tracking learn predictor set training dialogues, specified sequences quadruples; learned predictor needs able predict state current turn dialogue history. %Various models developed DST. Traditional works usually deal task incorporating Spoken Language Understanding module. These works make limited progress rely hand-crafted features. The neural networks thus used DST achieve much success. Many neural-network models successfully applied DST. These models usually solve DST problem two approaches, Implicit Tracking Explicit Tracking. As shown Figure , Implicit Tracking models employs recurrent networks accumulate features extracted historical system action user utterance pairs. A classifier built upon accumulated features state prediction. Although Implicit Tracking captures temporal feature dependencies recurrent-network cells, state dependencies explicitly modeled. Only considering temporal feature dependencies insufficient accurate state prediction. This fact confirmed via ablation study experiment. Unlike Implicit Tracking, Explicit Tracking approaches, NBT GLAD, model state dependencies explicitly. From model structure Figure, Explicit Tracking approaches first build classifier predict turn-level state turn utilize state aggregator state aggregation. %One branch models handle DST problem building immediate-state predictor map historical immediate states accumulative state. To distinguish branch models another one ignore immediate state directly model state accumulation Recurrent Neural Networks , name former indirect models latter direct models. Unlike indirect models, Direct models, including, explicitly model dependencies immediate state accumulative state. Indirect models like NBT GALD, build immediate-state predictors using features extracted current turn's system action user uttrance , update state deterministic rule heuristics. They use Convolutional Neural Networks attention-based RNNs feature extraction achieve remarkable improvements upon previous models. Despite success, two limitations existing indirect models. Despite achieving remarkable improvements upon previous models, current Explicit Tracking models improved two aspects. One temporal feature dependencies considered model design. The Explicit Tracking models extract features current system action user utterance pair. In practice, slot-value pairs different turns highly dependent. For example, user specifies appears future turn-level states. \end{center} :Feature Extractor, CNNs, RNNs. {\bf RC}:Recurrent Cell, LSTM, GRU. {\bf CL}:Classifier. {\bf SA}:State Aggregator.

The state-aggregation approaches current Explicit Tracking models sub-optimal. The deterministic rule GLAD propagate errors future turns lead incorrect state aggregation. The heuristic aggregation NBT needs estimate best configuration coefficient . An approach reduce error propagation require less parameter estimation necessary state aggregation. % The uncertainties state aggregation expressively modeled. The deterministic state aggregation rule used GLAD sub-optimal errors caused hard decision propagate future turns lead incorrect aggregation future states. The NBT aware uncertainty deal using simple rule-based aggregation. And best configuration coefficient need estimated. %In Figure, see TEN TEN-X model correctly estimate state first turn second turn. At third turn, suppose predicted turn-label probabilities values , TEN-X model using deterministic state updating rule , output wrong state value . On contrary, TEN model uncertainty modeling still obtain true state value higher confidence . This example indicates significance uncertainty modeling state estimation. Although turn labels states related deterministic mapping , models estimating state deterministic rules fact sub-optimal. This estimation current state averaged uncertainties estimation previous states turn labels. Such averaging effect ignored deterministic rules used state updating. Models attempt update states heuristics leave state updating learning task also sub-optimal. Actually, due fact deterministic mapping already exists, heuristics learned function may under-perform deterministic mapping. A proper solution maintain deterministic mapping handle uncertainties simultaneously. % This training dialogue, system estimates current state, arguably accounted uncertainties estimating previous state estimating current turn label. That is, system predictive distribution current state result averaged uncertainties. Updating state using deterministic rules essentially ignores averaging effect. % dependency need taken account turn label state prediction. 2) inadequate consideration uncertainty state estimates. The prediction current state consider uncertainty estimating previous state uncertainty estimating current turn label. 3) less expressive modelling known dialogue dynamics. The known dynamics turn labels states model explicitly. A detailed discussion limitation existing models depicted ""Related Works"" Section. % %{\bf Less expressive modelling known dialogue dynamics.} Some works, including, build DST models recurrent networks. They ignore provided turn labels directly use states training target. In models, temporal feature dependency considered predicting states. They however, explicitly model known dynamics turn labels states. Demanding additional capacity, models may under-perform models use turn labels training target. The immediate state important source estimating accumulative state accumulative state changes immediate state changed. In study, propose novel Temporally Expressive Networks jointly model temporal feature dependencies temporal state dependencies ). Specifically, improve turn-level state prediction, exploits hierarchical recurrent networks capture temporal feature dependencies across dialogue turns. Furthermore, reduce state aggregation errors, introduce factor graphs formulate state dependencies, employ belief propagation handle uncertainties state aggregation. Evaluating DSTC2, WOZ MultiWoZ datasets, TEN shown improve accuracy turn-level state prediction state aggregation. The TEN model establishes new state-of-the-art model DSTC2 dataset state-of-the-art comparable model WOZ dataset. %The system take action respond users basis estimated state. % The State Updating task fully studied among three subtasks. Some works avoid Turn-level Prediction directly update dialogue state using Recurrent Neural Networks. It's natural use RNN state updating, supervision turn labels considered. Some works train models turn labels, update dialogue states rule, performs compatible better models updating states RNN. The limitations updating rules used recent works are: The updating rule GLAD makes hard decision state ignores rich probabilistic distribution information, thus turn-level error may propagate cumulatively. The updating rule NBT rely carefully tuned hyperparameters simple rule difficulty handling complex nature state updating. The MDT proposes RNN-based updating rule training using outputs turn-level prediction model. However, updating rule trained independently turn-level prediction model. % In work, propose novel state updating model factor graphs, call Factor Graph Tracker . The FGT implemented sum-product algorithm effectively reduce cumulative error propagation. It natural use sum-product algorithm summary previous states turn-level goal updating current state. The FGT easily built upon turn-level prediction model unified model; turn-level prediction state updating thus jointly learned. The state tracking may benefit joint learning strategy. % Another limitation existing models dependency turn-level goals ignored turn-level prediction stage. We argue dependency turn-level goals considered. For example, area slot usually requested food slot requested; slot-value pair already imformed, lower probability expressed user current turn. Instead directly building classifiers predict turn-level goals, work, use GRU turn-label-tracker handle dependency turn-level goals build classifiers upon outputs turn-label-tracker. % The GLAD introduce attention machinisum propose Global-Locally Self-Attentive encoder feature extraction. Specifically, global self attention model bidirectional LSTM used extract global features input slot, local BiLSTMATT extracting slot-specific features. We propose slot attention encoder simplify GLSA encoder significantly decreases model parameters. In work, propose group-wise contrastive dialogue learning approach, explicitly perceives difference well-chosen positive negative utterances, manages multi-mapping relations human conversations simultaneously. Given training instance, proposed learning framework first organizes group positive samples negative samples regarding context-response matching degrees, trains target dialogue model give higher conditional probabilities positive pairs lower probabilities negatives. Extensive experimental results show proposed learning framework brings solid favorable performance boost amongst various strong baseline approaches."," Dialogue state tracking  is an important part of a spoken dialogue system. Existing DST models either ignore temporal feature dependencies across dialogue turns or fail to explicitly model temporal state dependencies in a dialogue. In this work, we propose Temporally Expressive Networks  to jointly model the two types of temporal dependencies in DST. The TEN model utilizes the power of recurrent networks and probabilistic graphical models. Evaluating on standard datasets, TEN is demonstrated to improve the accuracy of turn-level-state prediction and the state aggregation.   %The existing models usually solve DST problem by two approaches, Implicit Tracking and Explicit Tracking. The Implicit Tracking employs recurrent networks to model the temporal feature dependencies across dialogue turns, but fails to consider the temporal state dependencies. While Explicit Tracking models state dependencies explicitly, it ignores the feature dependencies.  %Dialogue state tracking  is an important part of a spoken dialogue system. Some of the prior arts for DST build an momentary-state predictor and map the historical immediate states to the accumulative state. These models are however insufficiently modelling the temporal dependencies across dialogue turns and the uncertainties in state updating. In this work, we introduce a probabilistic graphical model to formulate the dialogue process and propose Temporally Expressive Networks  that utilizes hierarchical recurrent networks and belief propagation to deal with these issues.

In contrast to traditional pipeline models, recent studies have focused on neural models, which are now able to convert a set of RDF triples into text in an end-to-end style with promising results. However, English is the only language widely targeted. We address this research gap by presenting NABU, a multilingual graph-based neural model that verbalizes RDF data to German, Russian, and English. NABU is based on an encoder-decoder architecture, uses an encoder inspired by Graph Attention Networks and a Transformer as decoder. Our approach relies on the fact that knowledge graphs are language-agnostic and they hence can be used to generate multilingual text. We evaluate NABU in monolingual and multilingual settings on standard benchmarking WebNLG datasets. Our results show that NABU outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on English with 66.21 BLEU, and achieves consistent results across all languages on the multilingual scenario with 56.04 BLEU. %Moreover, we trained bilingual models for analyzing the capability of NABU to model jointly distinct language families such as English-Russian.  %\todo{Which conclusion did you reach from this training?} \keywords{Knowledge Graphs  \and Natural Language Generation \and Semantic Web.}"

Many keys press writing keyboard act part inputs compose new datasets models shape communicate others. Nevertheless, happen way write code? Succinctly, yes.

Some research projects claim that they can generate text that can be interpreted as human-writing, enabling new possibilities in many application areas. Among the different areas related to language processing, one of the most notable in applying this type of modeling is programming languages. For years, the Machine Learning community has been researching this software engineering area, pursuing goals like applying different approaches to auto-complete, generate, fix, or evaluate code programmed by humans. Considering the increasing popularity of the Deep-Learning-enabled language models approach, we detected a lack of empirical papers that compare different deep learning architectures to create and use language models based on programming code. This paper compares different neural network architectures like AWD-LSTMs, AWD-QRNNs, and Transformer while using transfer learning and different tokenizations to see how they behave in building language models using a Python dataset for code generation and filling mask tasks.

"A dominant approach text generation use autoregressive models learned maximum likelihood estimation supervised data. However, approach introduces two well-known discrepancies training evaluation objectives lead undesired generations. % First, training loss negative log-likelihood, whereas evaluation based human judgment output quality. Under model misspecification, MLE tends over-generalize, assigning large probability mass high-quality low-quality sequences . Therefore, practice, must carefully select decoding algorithms produce high-quality outputs. Second, training, autoregressive model conditions gold history/prefix; however, inference time conditions model-generated history. This known exposure bias problem . In worst case, one incorrect prediction produce low-probability prefix gold data distribution, errors compound following steps . In practice, prior work observed problems repetition hallucination partly due exposure bias . We aim bridge gap training evaluation paper. To match training evaluation objectives, ideally maximize output quality given model-generated histories. This corresponds reinforcement learning objective: maximizing expected reward trajectories induced policy . However, optimizing objective notoriously difficult. Prior RL approaches mainly focus fine-tuning learned model optimize sequence-level metrics BLEU~, empirically remains unclear RL beneficial text generation . % Note many challenges RL arise exploring exponentially large space sequences, sparse rewards close reference. We thus propose learn reference sequences without interaction . Specifically, use off-policy policy gradient importance weighting , training examples higher probability model weighted higher. Further, reward functions approximate human judgment output quality estimating likely human would generated sequence. We call algorithm \algoname . Results news summarization, question generation, machine translation show \algoname leads better model performance MLE RL fine-tuning task metrics human-rated quality. Further, analysis shows \algoname learns high-precision models less sensitive decoding algorithms. In addition, alleviates exposure bias: output quality degrade much generation length increases. Considering results obtained, one could convincingly assert tokenization model used profoundly affects results generating automated source code. Although may accurate, must discuss carefully. First, overall results consistent existing literature . Sub-word tokenization works better case modeling source code, \citeyear{karampatsis2019maybe} stated. Every result obtained consistent sense. Even more, \citeyear{karpathy2016} envision, char tokenization probably best option try default dealing LMs source code. Furthermore, according results achieved, models GPT-2 -using tokenization model based BPE raw bytes- outperform LSTM/QRNN models like tested grasp better internals programming language. As showcased results, even GPT-2 best model terms accuracy, gave better code outputs ones selected comparison. As future work, would great check better textual output case GPT-2 a) much bigger better pre-trained model , b) related dataset's size quality, c) related causes or, d) related issues. Continuing comments accuracy, one may note textual outputs generated AWD-LSTM char, AWD-QRNN char, GPT-2 could polished accurate. The final training loss higher validation loss three selected DNN architectures, sign underfitting. We find issue BERT RoBERTa-based models. Whether purpose paper produce state-of-the-art results per se, continued training five epochs verify it. The improvement obtained extending training best approaches residual general, decided report results 1+30 epochs AWD-LSTMs AWD-QRNNs, 1+10 epochs Transformer. Regarding pre-training transfer learning, every pre-trained model got better accuracy non-pre-trained counterparts except word tokenization models. It seems strongly related statements introduced beginning paper, citing source code restrictions sense common words neologisms. In sense, conclusion comes mind rapidly: consider source code words 閳ユ辅ord閳 units, probably fit fixed set words used human language like English. So, LM閳ユ獨 knowledge acquired pre-training entirely valid get fixed set words compose language. Most words programming language neologisms LMs pre-trained English, thus, needs incorporate relationships learned knowledge. For sub-word units, LM less sensible neologisms. Potentially, could robust divided word since set bytes chars straightforward chunks present richer constructions information units. Going deeper research, concerning pre-training effect LMs modeling source code, could worth researching relationship pre-training different human-spoken languages LM ability work existing source code specific programming languages. About tests made generating source code filling blanks using trained LMs, think that, general, textual results obtained good, yet informative LMs working improved. One things explain results dataset used. In case, used public dataset researchers use make results experiments comparable replicable. In literature, find standard dataset tasks compare easily. Other papers use custom datasets, find lack literature well-recognized code datasets use. Comparing recent papers NLP field used basis research , dataset may relatively small train big LM accomplish appropriately challenging tasks like generating source code auto-completing it. Future work may testing new approaches bigger datasets train big LMs focused modeling Python language checking whether results better. Recent examples LMs -such GPT-3 - claim produce accurate textual outputs even contexts trained. Part explanation given ability use gargantuan datasets combined Transformer attention-based architectures. So, approaches also relevant contexts like ours. Another line future research using datasets focused specific libraries Python aspects verify approaches specialize positively contexts DNN models used paper. Related evaluating code generated filled, observed literature different approaches . In context LMs modeling source code, many papers software libraries devoted translating programming languages typically evaluate text generation using methods metrics like BLEU , variants like SacreBLEU . Other papers like rely accuracy assess LM閳ユ獨 performance based deep learning. Some models even solve different tasks part existing benchmarks evaluated, checking perplexity . The current tendency large models evaluate using human intervention evaluate output閳ユ獨 quality . We assessed models using accuracy experiments evaluated models閳 textual outputs based prior human knowledge. It would interesting future plan new evaluation processes involving larger cohorts source code experts evaluate models do. One potential new assessments usability tests conducted programmers. They compare code would write code proposed DNNs presented result common code auto-completion tools included integrated development environments. As outlined results section, relying metrics like accuracy enough. As case, accuracy metrics good indicator model閳ユ獨 performance, yet need verify LMs behavior quality using complementary methods like specialized metrics human evaluation. For tasks like auto-completion source code generation, existing specialized metrics , one future research lines improving evaluation LMs source code. Based existing ideas broad NLP, many opportunities explore sense.

We studied different DNN architectures like AWD-LSTM, AWD-QRNN, Transformer seek kind work better different tokenization models . Also, compared pre-training effect results given LMs training fine-tuning via transfer learning work languages .

This paradigm leads to       diverse but low-quality samples due to mismatched learning objective and evaluation metric      and  exposure bias due to mismatched history distributions .      To alleviate these problems, we frame text generation as an offline reinforcement learning  problem with expert demonstrations ,     where the goal is to maximize quality given model-generated histories.      We propose \algoname :     an easy-to-optimize algorithm that learns from the demonstrations by importance weighting.      Intuitively, \algoname upweights confident tokens and downweights unconfident ones in the reference during training,      avoiding optimization issues faced by prior RL approaches that rely on online data collection.     According to both automatic and human evaluation,     models trained by \algoname outperform those trained by MLE and policy gradient      on summarization, question generation, and machine translation.      Further, our models are less sensitive to decoding algorithms     and alleviate exposure bias."

Among topics, video QA especially challenging, requires fine-grained understanding video language. \sh{Figure shows example multiple-choice video QA TVQA dataset. The multiple-choice video QA task requires model select correct answer given question, corresponding video frames, subtitles.} We provide efficient algorithm addresses two train/test discrepancies MLE training text generation: likelihood learning objective vs. quality evaluation metric; gold history training vs. model-generated history inference. We demonstrated off-policy RL promising framework text generation, matched train/test objectives optimization advantages like MLE. We believe advanced off-policy learning techniques easily integrated text generation improve performance."," Video Question Answering  requires fine-grained understanding of both video and language modalities to answer the given questions. In this paper, we propose novel training schemes for multiple-choice video question answering with a self-supervised pre-training stage and a supervised contrastive learning in the main stage as an auxiliary learning. In the self-supervised pre-training stage, we transform the original problem format of predicting the correct answer into the one that predicts the relevant question to provide a model with broader contextual inputs without any further dataset or annotation. For contrastive learning in the main stage, we add a masking noise to the input corresponding to the ground-truth answer, and consider the original input of the ground-truth answer as a positive sample, while treating the rest as negative samples. By mapping the positive sample closer to the masked input, we show that the model performance is improved. We further employ locally aligned attention to focus more effectively on the video frames that are particularly relevant to the given corresponding subtitle sentences. We evaluate our proposed model on highly competitive benchmark datasets related to multiple-choice video QA: TVQA, TVQA+, and DramaQA. Experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on all datasets. We also validate our approaches through further analyses."
"Neural machine translation typically follows encoder-decoder framework, directly applies single neural network transform source sentence target sentence. With tens millions trainable parameters NMT model, translation tasks usually data-hungry, many low-resource even zero-resource terms training data. Following idea unsupervised self-supervised pre-training methods NLP area , works proposed improve NMT model pre-training, making full use widely available monolingual corpora . Typically, two different branches pre-training approaches proposed NMT: model-fusion parameter-initialization. The model-fusion approaches seek incorporate sentence representation provided pre-trained model, BERT, NMT model . These approaches able leverage publicly available pre-trained checkpoints website need change NMT model fuse sentence embedding calculated pre-trained model. Large-scale parameters pre-trained model significantly increase storage cost inference time, makes hard branch approaches directly used production. As opposed model-fusion approaches, parameter-initialization approaches aim directly pre-train whole part NMT model tailored objectives, initialize NMT model pre-trained parameters . These approaches production-ready since keep size structure model standard NMT systems. While achieving substantial improvements, pre-training approaches two main cons. Firstly, pointed \citet{yang2019xlnet}, artificial symbols like [mask] used approaches pre-training absent real data fine-tuning time, resulting pretrain-finetune discrepancy. Secondly, pre-training step involves sentences language, approaches unable make use cross-lingual alignment information contained source target monolingual corpus. We argue that, cross-lingual sequence generation task, NMT requires tailored pre-training objective capable making use cross-lingual alignment signals explicitly, e.g., word-pair information extracted source target monolingual corpus, improve performance. To address limitations mentioned above, propose Code-Switching Pre-training NMT. We extract word-pair alignment information source target monolingual corpus automatically, apply extracted alignment information enhance pre-training performance. The detailed training process CSP presented two steps: 1) perform lexicon induction get translation lexicons unsupervised word embedding mapping ; 2) randomly replace words input sentence translation words extracted translation lexicons train NMT model predict replaced words. CSP adopts encoder-decoder framework: encoder takes code-mixed sentence input, decoder predicts replaced fragments based context calculated encoder. By predicting sentence fragment replaced encoder side, CSP able either attend remaining words source language translation words replaced fragment target language. Therefore, CSP trains NMT model to: 1) learn build sentence representation input sentence traditional pre-training methods do; 2) learn perform cross-lingual translation extracted word-pair alignment information. In summary, mainly make following contributions: \footnotetext[1]{To used production easily, models need distilled student model structure size standard NMT systems.} \sh{Video QA requires fine-grained understanding video language modalities.

Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance three highly challenging video QA datasets. We expect proposed method applied various multiple-choice video QA tasks, bringing performance improvement.","  This paper proposes a new pre-training method, called Code-Switching Pre-training  for Neural Machine Translation . Unlike traditional pre-training method which randomly masks some fragments of the input sentence,  the proposed CSP randomly replaces some words in the source sentence with their translation words in the target language. Specifically, we firstly perform lexicon induction with unsupervised word embedding mapping between the source and target languages, and then randomly replace some words in the input sentence with their translation words according to the extracted translation lexicons. CSP adopts the encoder-decoder framework: its encoder takes the code-mixed sentence as input, and its decoder predicts the replaced fragment of the input sentence. In this way, CSP is able to pre-train the NMT model by explicitly making the most of the cross-lingual alignment information extracted from the source and target monolingual corpus. Additionally,  we relieve the pretrain-finetune discrepancy caused by the artificial symbols like [mask].  To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on unsupervised and supervised NMT. Experimental results show that CSP achieves significant improvements over baselines without pre-training or with other pre-training methods."

However, in contrast to the rapid development in other domains, such as Computer Vision, the progress of FSL in Nature Language Processing  is much slower.  One of the key reasons for this is the lacking of public benchmarks.  NLP FSL researches always report new results on their own constructed few-shot datasets, which is pretty inefficient in results comparison and thus impedes cumulative progress. In this paper, we present FewJoint, a novel Few-Shot Learning benchmark for NLP.  Different from most NLP FSL research that only focus on simple N-classification problems, our benchmark introduces few-shot joint dialogue language understanding, which additionally covers the structure prediction and multi-task reliance problems.  This allows our benchmark to reflect the real-word NLP complexity beyond simple N-classification.  Our benchmark is used in the few-shot learning contest of SMP2020-ECDT task-1.\footnote{The Eighth China National Conference on Social Media Processing.

"Event coreference resolution aims identify event mentions document refer event . For example, two event mentions Figure , departing leave, refer EndPosition event Nokia's CEO. Traditional event coreference resolution methods usually rely series upstream components , entity recognition event detection. Such pipeline framework, unfortunately, often suffers error propagation problem. For instance, best event detection system KBP 2017 achieved 56 F1 , undoubtedly limit performance follow-up event coreference task . Furthermore, previous approaches use hand-crafted features , heavily depend NLP components thus hard generalize new languages/domains/datasets. In paper, propose End-to-End Event Coreference method -- neural network, predict event chains raw text end-to-end manner. For example, taking raw text Figure input, directly output two event coreference chains, \{departing, leave, goodbye\} \{rejoin\}. By jointly modeling event detection event coreference, neural network require prior components, representations/pieces evidence different tasks different decisions shared reinforced. Besides, learned end-to-end manner, inherently resolve error propagation problem. End-to-end event coreference, however, challenging due mention diversity long-distance coreference. First, event mentions highly diversified , may variety syntactic objects, including nouns, verbs, even adjectives. For example, EndPosition event triggered departing, leave, goodbye former. By contrast, mentions entity coreference mostly noun phrases . Second, coreferential event mentions commonly appear long-distance sentences, therefore event coreference intricately governed long-distance, semantic-dependent decisions . For example, Figure closest antecedent\footnote{In paper, antecedents coreferential mentions appear earlier document.} mention goodbye -- leave, far it. To resolve coreference two distant, diverse event mentions, system rely semantic meanings, i.e., describe EndPosition event different perspectives. By contrast, entity mentions' closest antecedents immediately preceding sentence , resolved easily using local syntactic clues. To resolve mention diversity problem long-distance coreference problem, paper proposes type-guided mechanism neural network. This mechanism bridges distant, diverse event mentions exploiting event type information three folds: 1) type-informed antecedent network enables capture semantic information event mentions predicting coreferential scores type scores simultaneously; 2) type-refined mention representation enhances mention representation type information, therefore even lexically dissimilar mentions bridged together, two diverse EndPosition mentions goodbye departing; 3) type-guided decoding algorithm exploit global type consistency accurate event chains.

In this paper, we propose an End-to-End Event Coreference approach -- $\text{E}^{3}\text{C}$ neural network, which can jointly model event detection and event coreference resolution tasks, and learn to extract features from raw text automatically.   Furthermore, because event mentions are highly diversified and event coreference is intricately governed by long-distance, semantic-dependent decisions, a type-guided event coreference mechanism is further proposed in our $\text{E}^{3}\text{C}$ neural network.

However, these algorithms require sequential computation that makes parallelization impossible.

Based on this algorithm, we design an approximate inference network that can be connected with the encoder of the neural CRF model to form an end-to-end network, which is amenable to parallelization for faster training and prediction. The empirical results show that our proposed approaches achieve a 12.7-fold improvement in decoding speed with long sentences and a competitive accuracy compared with the traditional CRF approach."

However, recent deep learning based topic models, specifically aspect-based autoencoder, suffer from several problems such as extracting noisy aspects and poorly mapping aspects discovered by models to the aspects of interest. To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we first propose a self-supervised contrastive learning framework and an attention-based model equipped with a novel smooth self-attention  module for the UAD task in order to learn better representations for aspects and review segments. Secondly, we introduce a high-resolution selective mapping  method to efficiently assign aspects discovered by the model to the aspects of interest. We also propose using a knowledge distillation technique to further improve the aspect detection performance. Our methods outperform several recent unsupervised and weakly supervised approaches on publicly available benchmark user review datasets. Aspect interpretation results show that extracted aspects are meaningful, have a good coverage, and can be easily mapped to aspects of interest. Ablation studies and attention weight visualization also demonstrate effectiveness of SSA and the knowledge distillation method."

Multi-Aspect Rating Prediction , where the goal is to predict the ratings from a review at an individual aspect level, has become a challenging and an imminent problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a deliberate self-attention deep neural network model, named as FEDAR, for the MARP problem, which can achieve competitive performance while also being able to interpret the predictions made. As opposed to the previous studies, which make use of hand-crafted keywords to determine aspects in sentiment predictions, our model does not suffer from human bias issues since aspect keywords are automatically detected through a self-attention mechanism. FEDAR is equipped with a highway word embedding layer to transfer knowledge from pre-trained word embeddings, an RNN encoder layer with output features enriched by pooling and factorization techniques, and a deliberate self-attention layer. In addition, we also propose an Attention-driven Keywords Ranking  method, which can automatically extract aspect-level sentiment-related keywords from the review corpus based on the attention weights. Since crowdsourcing annotation can be an alternate way to recover missing ratings of reviews, we propose a LEcture-AuDience  strategy to estimate model uncertainty in the context of multi-task learning, so that valuable human resources can focus on the most uncertain predictions. Our extensive set of experiments on different DMSC datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed FEDAR and LEAD models. Visualization of aspect-level sentiment keywords demonstrate the interpretability of our model and effectiveness of our AKR method."

However, the gap between machine translation systems and human translators needs to be manually closed by post-editing.  In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework of %as a computer assisted crowdsourcing system for  the quality estimation and automatic post-editing of the machine translation output.  Our goal is to provide error correction suggestions and to further relieve the burden of human translators through an interpretable model.  To imitate the behavior of human translators, we design three efficient delegation modules -- quality estimation, generative post-editing, and atomic operation post-editing and construct a hierarchical model based on them.  %When the quality estimation model predicts the translation to be poor, the generative post-editing module is called to completely rephrase the translation.  % In contrast, the translation quality is high, the output only needs several atomic operations, such as deletion, insertion, or substitution.  We examine this approach with the English--German dataset from WMT 2017 APE shared task and our experimental results can achieve the state-of-the-art performance.  We also verify that the certified translators can significantly expedite their post-editing processing with our model in human evaluation."
"Recent advances deep learning led significant improvement Neural Machine Translation . Particularly, performance sentence-level translation low- high- resource language pairs dramatically improved . However, translating text long-range dependencies, conversations documents, original mode translating one sentence time ignores discourse phenomena , introducing undesirable behaviors inconsistent pronouns across different translated sentences. Document-level NMT, realistic translation task scenarios, systematically investigated machine translation community. Most literatures focused looking back fixed number previous source target sentences document-level context . Some latest works innovatively attempted either get entire document context dynamically select suitable context . Because scarcity document training data, benefit gained approach, reflected BLEU, usually limited. We therefore elect pay attention context previous sentences small number usually cover entire document. Almost latest studies chose standard transformer model baseline translates sentence document model trained sentence-level data. The cohesion consistency general poor. A reasonable baseline train transformer context prepended, modification could simply implemented via data preprocessing. \citet{bawden2018evaluating} conducted detailed analysis RNN-based NMT models topic whether include extended context. Consistency precision often viewed trade-off other. We conduct detailed analysis effect document context consistency transformer architecture accepting multi-sentence input. When comes leveraging contextual information, common approach model interaction sentence context specially designed attention modules . Such works tend include one encoder decoder, substantial number parameters additional computations. In work, reduce contextual regular attention modules one single encoder decoder. Our idea motivated one transformer decoder two-stream self-attention . % In particular, maintain two different sets hidden states employ two different masking matrices capture long short term dependencies. The contributions paper threefold: i) extensively research performance standard transformer setting multi-sentence input output; ii) propose simple effective modification adapting transformer document NMT aim ameliorating effect error accumulation; iii) experiments demonstrate even simple baseline achieve comparable results. Our studies show offer efficient computer assisted translation crowdsourcing system reduce time cost human labor. An interesting point mention difference training inference algorithms. The latter exclusively enjoys benefits iterative update former not. So natural question whether iterative update QE atomic operation APE successfully plugged training process. The short answer yes. Because simplest way replace current inner loop model specialization Algorithm similar iterative update used inference, rationales data augmentation. Particularly, model parameters encoder-memory encoder updated via loss minimization, infer current atomic operation APE assign machine translation, {\itshape i.e.} substituting new tuple Line 4 Algorithm. We implemented idea found results became worse. We hypothesize probably original model specialization bring diversity errors machine translation models learning. Therefore, theoretically reasonable modification combine original model specialization iterative update together, computationally feasible training cost significantly increase several folds. It might argued final hierarchical system, automatically selects suitable model inference, special case conventional two-model ensemble, not. The standard ensemble method requires inference trained models, combines predicted distribution token. In contrast, hierarchical model need infer selected model once. If for-loop exits early Algorithm, generative model applied. If iterative update desired, atomic operation model runs 5 iterations, usually faster generative model. This difference hierarchical APE system standard ensemble multiple single models makes system faster. But that, motivation propose hierarchical model better model editing behaviors human translators. The decision making process allows discriminatory APE machine translation outputs vary qualities."," Many document-level neural machine translation  systems have explored the utility of context-aware architecture, usually requiring an increasing number of parameters and computational complexity.  However, few attention is paid to the baseline model.  In this paper, we research extensively the pros and cons of the standard transformer in document-level translation, and find that the auto-regressive property can simultaneously bring both the advantage of the consistency and the disadvantage of error accumulation.  Therefore, we propose a surprisingly simple long-short term masking self-attention on top of the standard transformer to both effectively capture the long-range dependence and reduce the propagation of errors.  We examine our approach on the two publicly available document-level datasets.  We can achieve a strong result in BLEU and capture discourse phenomena."

In the field of natural language processing, various textual adversarial attack models have been proposed, varying in the accessibility to the victim model. Among them, the attack models that only require the output of the victim model are more fit for real-world situations of adversarial attacking. However, to achieve high attack performance, these models usually need to query the victim model too many times, which is neither efficient nor viable in practice. To tackle this problem, we propose a reinforcement learning based attack model, which can learn from attack history and launch attacks more efficiently.

In low-resource scenarios, NMT models tend to over-fit because the softmax distribution quickly approaches the gold label distribution. To address this issue, we propose to divide the logits by a temperature coefficient, prior to applying softmax, during training. In our experiments on 11 language pairs in the Asian Language Treebank dataset and the WMT 2019 English-to-German translation task, we observed significant improvements in translation quality by up to 3.9 BLEU points. Furthermore, softmax tempering makes the greedy search to be as good as beam search decoding in terms of translation quality, enabling 1.5 to 3.5 times speed-up. We also study the impact of softmax tempering on multilingual NMT and recurrently stacked NMT, both of which aim to reduce the NMT model size by parameter sharing thereby verifying the utility of temperature in developing compact NMT models. Finally, an analysis of softmax entropies and gradients reveal the impact of our method on the internal behavior of NMT models."

In this paper, we focus on Causal Explanation Detection, an important subtask of causal explanation analysis, which determines whether a causal explanation exists in one message. We design a Pyramid Salient-Aware Network  to detect causal explanations on messages. PSAN can assist in causal explanation detection via capturing the salient semantics of discourses contained in their keywords with a bottom graph-based word-level salient network. Furthermore, PSAN can modify the dominance of discourses via a top attention-based discourse-level salient network to enhance explanatory semantics of messages. The experiments on the commonly used dataset of CEA shows that the PSAN outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 1.8\% F1 value on the Causal Explanation Detection task."
"Event coreference resolution task determining event mentions document refer real-world event. Event coreference resolution important part NLP systems summarization, text-level event extraction, question answering on. Besides, compared considerable research entity coreference resolution, less attention event coreference resolution. Therefore, event coreference resolution still challenging task performance improved. Event mentions refer event occur within document across multiple documents . We focus WD event coreference paper WD event coreference basic work CD event coreference. The main task WD event coreference judging whether pair events coreferential not. Figure shows two coreferential event pairs two documents. The first event pair D1 shooting event second event pair D2 fire event. In order judge coreference event pair, approaches solving event coreference resolution relied various linguistic properties especially event argument, contains {spatio-temporal} information events. For instances, Figure, words red front events. And words blue, green orange front participant, time, location events respectively. Although event arguments contain useful information event coreference resolution, two problems using event arguments information event coreference resolution. Firstly, difficult extract event arguments accurately due diversity expression event arguments. The performance event argument extraction 55.7 ACE corpus. For instance, D1, arguments shooting event two sentences expressed differently. In details, D1, participant, time, location shooting event worker/2 women, 8:30 p.m. kraft S1, women, Friday evening building S2 respectively. Secondly, every event mention contains arguments one event may make model confused coreference two events event pair. For instance, D2, Wasilla Bible Church location fire event S1 S2. Besides, D2, devoid event arguments, burned event fire event coreferential context. As aforementioned, arguments events difficult extract. It also difficult use arguments solve problems event coreference resolution even extracted. Thus, context event mentions important effective event coreference resolution. In order use context information efficiently, propose multi-loss neural network model need argument information accomplish within-document event coreference resolution task. We propose two sub-models use context information detect coreference two events event pair train jointly. One classifier predicts whether two events one pair coreferential, another scorer calculates similarity scores assist infer coreference. The final stage event coreference resolution event clustering. After event pairs predicted scored, filter event pairs according results classifier scorer. Then, use dynamic connectivity algorithm construct graph event clustering. Each node graph event mention edge two nodes represent whether two event coreferential not. Finally, events connected one graph considered one event cluster. We evaluate model ECB+ corpus use B, CEAF, MUC CoNLL measures. The experimental results show model achieve significant improvement compared state-of-the-art methods use event argument features. In paper, devise pyramid salient-aware network detect causal explanations messages. PSAN effectively learn key relation words word level filter key information discourse level terms explanatory semantics. Specifically, propose bottom word-level salient-aware module capture salient semantics discourses contained keywords based syntactic-centric graph. We also propose top discourse-level salient-aware module modify dominance different discourses terms global explanatory semantic constraint via attention mechanism. Experimental results open-accessed commonly used datasets show model achieves best performance.","Event coreference resolution is an important task in Natural Language Processing  and nearly all the existing approaches to this task  rely on event argument information. However, these methods tend to suffer from error propagation from the stage of event argument extraction. Besides, not every event mention contains all arguments of an event and argument information may confuse the model that events have arguments to detect event coreference in real text. Furthermore, the context information of an event is useful to infer coreference between events. Thus, in order to reduce the errors propagated from event argument extraction and use context information effectively, we propose a multi-loss neural network model which does not need any argument information to do the within-document event coreference resolution task and achieve a significant performance than the state-of-the-art methods."
"A task-oriented spoken dialogue system usually consists three modules: input,output control, shown Fig.. The input module consists automatic speech recognition spoken language understanding extracts semantic-level user dialogue actions user speech signal. The control module two missions. One maintain dialogue state, encoding machine's understanding conversation. Once information input module received, dialogue state updated dialogue state tracking . The choose semantic-level machine dialogue action response user, called dialogue decision policy. The output consists natural language generation text-to-speech synthesis, convert dialogue action audio. Dialogue management important part dialogue system. Nevertheless, inevitable ASR SLU errors make hard track true dialogue state make decision. In recent statistical dialogue system, distribution dialogue state, i.e. belief state, tracked. A well-founded theory belief tracking decision making offered partially observable Markov Decision Process framework. Previous DST algorithms divided three families: hand-crafted rules, generative models, discriminative models. Recently, since Dialog State Tracking Challenges provided labelled dialog state tracking data common evaluation framework test-bed, variety machine learning methods DST proposed. These methods rely strictly set labelled off-line data. Since labelled data off-line, learning process supervised learning methods independent dialogue policy module. The key issues supervised learning methods poor generalization over-tuning. Due lack labels, approaches easily used on-line update DST. This work marks first step towards employing deep reinforcement learning method dialogue state tracking module. The performance DST module optimized conversation user dialogue system.

It is usually cast as a supervised training problem, which is not convenient for on-line optimization. In this paper, a novel companion teaching based deep reinforcement learning  framework for on-line DST optimization is proposed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to optimize the DST module within DRL framework for on-line task-oriented spoken dialogue systems. In addition, dialogue policy can be further jointly updated. Experiments show that on-line DST optimization can effectively improve the dialogue manager performance while keeping the flexibility of using predefined policy.

"{T}{he} task-oriented spoken dialogue system aims assist human user accomplishing specific task . The dialogue management core part SDS. There two main missions dialogue management: dialogue belief state tracking dialogue decision-making . In work, focus devising policy chooses dialogue action respond user. The sequential system decision-making process abstracted partially observable Markov decision process . Under framework, reinforcement learning approaches used automated policy optimization. In past years, many deep reinforcement learning algorithms閿 use neural networks function approximators, investigated dialogue policy . Most approaches focus dialogue policy optimization single dialogue task. However, real-life scenarios, dialogue agent asked many users different dialogue tasks, e.g., Apple Siri support many dialogue tasks . In multi-task setup, traditional DRL-based approaches train individual policy dialogue task. It means dialogue policy independent model parameters, whose scale increase proportionally number tasks. One solution train generic policy dialogue tasks . However, two obstacles traditional DRL-based approaches. In paper, propose Structured Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning Universal Dialogue Management address two problems. It use data collected different dialogue tasks train generic policy. To tackle scalability problem, utilize recently proposed structured dialogue policy , dialogue policy represented graph neural network . With scalability GNN , single set parameters used different dialogue tasks. That makes possible train generic policy among multiple dialogue tasks. To tackle efficiency problem, deploy advanced off-policy actor-critic algorithm, combines decoupled acting learning novel off-policy correction method called V-trace. Combining improved optimization algorithm structured dialogue policy, make generic policy learning process stable efficient original GNN-based dialogue policy . We evaluate performance STRAC PyDial benchmark, includes six environments three dialogue domains. Results show unified dialogue agent STRAC gets best performance 18 tasks benchmark. This paper provides DRL-based companion teaching framework optimize DST module dialogue system. Under framework, tracker learned conversations user SDS rather produced off-line methods. We also choose jointly train dialogue policy agent tracking agent framework. The experiments showed proposed companion teaching framework on-line DST system achieved promising performances DSTC2 DSTC3."," Traditional dialogue policy needs to be trained independently for each dialogue task. In this work, we aim to solve a collection of independent dialogue tasks using a unified dialogue agent. The unified policy is parallelly trained using the conversation data from all of the distributed dialogue tasks. However, there are two key challenges: the design of a unified dialogue model to adapt to different dialogue tasks;  finding a robust reinforcement learning method to keep the efficiency and the stability of the training process. Here we propose a novel structured actor-critic approach to implement structured deep reinforcement learning , which not only can learn parallelly from data of different dialogue tasks\footnote{In the experimental setup of this work, each dialogue task has only one dialogue domain.} but also achieves stable and sample-efficient learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on 18 tasks of PyDial benchmark. The results show that our method is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance."
"%When building dialogue system, complex tasks require information exchange often challenging. One example handle restaurant reservation consultation multiple areas single conversation. Specifically, type task needs complete subtasks order finish conversation called composite task. Composite tasks different multi-domain dialogue tasks. The latter often mentioned papers focusing transfer learning. In case, multi-domain dialogue tasks involve one domain single dialogue, performance one domain model tested different domains order highlight transferability. On contrary, composite dialogue tasks may involve multiple domains single dialogue, agent must complete subtasks order get positive feedback. Consider process completing composite task . An agent first chooses subtask , make sequence decisions gather related information information required users provided subtasks completed, choose next subtask complete. The state-action space increase number subtasks. Thus, dialogue policy learning composite task needs exploration, needs take dialogue turn agent user complete composite task. The sparse reward problem magnified. Solving composite tasks using method one solving single domain tasks may hit obstacles. The complexity composite task makes hard agent learn acceptable strategy. While hierarchical deep reinforcement learning shows promising power, introducing framework options Markov Decision Process , original task decomposed two parts: deciding subtask solve solve one subtask, thus simplifying problem. However, previous works, multi-layer perceptrons often used DQN estimate Q-value. MLPs use concatenation flatten dialogue state inputs. In way, cannot capture structural information semantic slots state easily, results low sampling efficiency. In work, propose ComNet, makes use Graph Neural Network better leverage graph structure observations coherent HDRL method. Our main contributions three-fold: 1. We propose new framework ComNet combining HDRL GNN solve composite tasks achieving sample efficiency. 2. We test ComNet based PyDial benchmark show result over-performed vanilla HDRL systems robust noise environment. 3. We test transferability framework prove framework, efficient accurate transfer possible. This paper proposed scalable distributed dialogue policy STRAC train generic dialogue policy available data collected different dialogue tasks. STRAC increased scalability, stability efficiency NN-based policy combining structured dialogue policy effective off-policy actor-critic algorithm. Compared traditional approaches, STRAC-M trained parallel multiple tasks gets better performance, especially data-limited situation. Compared another GNN-based policy optimization approach FM-GNN, training process STRAC stable efficient. The final gains considerable complex environments. Compared recent proposed generic policy DQNDIP-M, STRAC-M trained using data available dialogue tasks also model relations among sub-agents. In future work, test STRAC real users instead agenda-based user simulator. single appendix: [Proof Zonklar Equations] appendix heading use"," Dialogue policy training for composite tasks, such as restaurant reservation in multiple places, is a practically important and challenging problem. Recently, hierarchical deep reinforcement learning  methods have achieved good performance in composite tasks. However, in vanilla HDRL, both top-level and low-level policies are all represented by multi-layer perceptrons  which take the concatenation of all observations from the environment as the input for predicting actions. Thus, traditional HDRL approach often suffers from low sampling efficiency and poor transferability. In this paper, we address these problems by utilizing the flexibility of graph neural networks . A novel ComNet is proposed to model the structure of a hierarchical agent. The performance of ComNet is tested on composited tasks of the PyDial benchmark. Experiments show that ComNet outperforms vanilla HDRL systems with performance close to the upper bound. It not only achieves sample efficiency but also is more robust to noise while maintaining the transferability to other composite tasks."
"Relation extraction aims identify semantic relations named entities text. While previous work focuses extracting relations within sentence, a.k.a.~sentence-level RE, recent studies escalated document level, since large amount relations entities usually span across multiple sentences real world. According analysis Wikipedia corpus , least 40.7\% relations extracted document level. Compared sentence-level RE, document-level RE requires complex reasoning, logical reasoning, coreference reasoning common-sense reasoning. A document often contains many entities, entities multiple mentions phrase alias. To identify relations entities appearing different sentences, document-level RE models must capable modeling complex interactions multiple entities synthesizing context information multiple mentions. Figure shows example document-level RE. Assume one wants extract relation ``Surfers Riverwalk"" S11 ``Queensland"" S1. One find ``Surfers Riverwalk"" contains ``Pacific Fair"" , ``Pacific Fair"" located ``Queensland"" . This chain interactions helps infer inter-sentential relation ``located in"" ``Surfers Riverwalk"" ``Queensland"". %==================== In paper, propose ComNet, structured hierarchical dialogue policy represented two graph neural networks . By replacing MLPs traditional HDRL methods, ComNet makes better use structural information dialogue state separately feeding observations top-level decision slot-dependent, slot-independent subtask nodes exchange message nodes. We evaluate framework modified PyDial benchmark show high efficiency, robustness transferability settings."," Relation extraction  aims to identify the semantic relations between named entities in text. Recent years have witnessed it raised to the document level, which requires complex reasoning with entities and mentions throughout an entire document. In this paper, we propose a novel model to document-level RE, by encoding the document information in terms of entity global and local representations as well as context relation representations. Entity global representations model the semantic information of all entities in the document, entity local representations aggregate the contextual information of multiple mentions of specific entities, and context relation representations encode the topic information of other relations. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance on two public datasets for document-level RE. It is particularly effective in extracting relations between entities of long distance and having multiple mentions."
"Dialogue state tracker core part task-oriented dialogue system, records dialogue state. The dialogue state consists set domain-slot-value triples, specific value represents user goal, e.g., . The dialogue system responds user based dialogue state. Thus, order make dialogue process natural fluent, essential extract dialogue state dialogue context accurately. However, paucity annotated data main challenge field. In work, solve key problem learn unlabeled data DST task. We design dual learning framework DST task, dialogue state tracker primal agent dual agent utterance generator. Within dual learning framework, two primal-dual agents help update external reward signals reconstruction errors using unlabeled data. It needs labeled dialogue data warm two primal-dual agents. However, two main challenges combining dual learning framework previous dialogue state tracking methods: How represent dialogue state dual learning framework? Dual learning method first proposed neural machine translation task. The outputs primal-dual agents NMT task sequential natural languages. However, DST task, output dialogue state tracker consists isolated domain-slot-value triples. The traditional DST task formulated classification problem given ontology, possible values corresponding slot listed. Under problem definition, previous classification methods choose right value slot. The recent innovated tracker TRADE directly generates values slot slot using copy mechanism dialogue context. However, tracker methods get slot values independently. During dual learning loop, hard get reward signal independent slot values. The reward signal dual utterance generator also hard allocate isolated value generation processes. Since relations predicted values modeled assumed independent other, would face serious reward sparse problem. In work, reformulate dialogue state tracking task sequential generation task. The whole dialogue state represented sequence structured information. For example, state represented ``\textless\textgreater \textless\textgreater \textless\textgreater \textless\textgreater \textless\textgreater \textless\textgreater \textless\textgreater''. Is reasonable generating whole dialogue context dialogue state? The intuitive dual task state tracker dialogue context generation. However, MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset, dialogue context 10 turns average average length sentence 10 tokens. It difficult generating accurately dialogue context dialogue state. Because dialogue context long, hard guarantee generated dialogue context contains semantics given state. In work, simplify dual task user utterance generation task ignores specific values given state. The input dual task composed two parts , output delexicalized user utterance. The delexicalized script copied released code \footnote{https://github.com/ConvLab/ConvLab}. The system utterance user utterance lexicalized respectively according given turn state. We get new pseudo-labeled dialogue turn. In order produce multi-turn pseudo-labeled data, sample labeled dialogue data combine pseudo-labeled dialogue turn, dialogue turn directly adds end sampled dialogue context turn state covers label sampled state. Finally, get new dialogue context pseudo label state, intuitive dual-task does. The main contributions paper summarized follows: In paper, proposed GLRE, global-to-local neural network document-level RE. Entity global representations model semantic information entire document R-GCN, entity local representations aggregate contextual information mentions selectively using multi-head attention. Moreover, context relation representations encode topic information relations using self-attention. Our experiments demonstrated superiority GLRE many comparative models, especially big leads extracting relations entities long distance multiple mentions. In future work, plan integrate knowledge graphs explore document graph modeling ways improve performance.\\ Acknowledgments.

Dialogue state tracking  is to estimate the dialogue state at each turn. Due to the dependency on complicated dialogue history contexts, DST data annotation is more expensive than single-sentence language understanding, which makes the task more challenging. In this work, we formulate DST as a sequence generation problem and propose a novel dual-learning framework to make full use of unlabeled data. In the dual-learning framework, there are two agents: the primal tracker agent  and the dual utterance generator agent . Compared with traditional supervised learning framework, dual learning can iteratively update both agents through the reconstruction error and reward signal respectively without labeled data. Reward sparsity problem is hard to solve in previous DST methods. In this work, the reformulation of DST as a sequence generation model effectively alleviates this problem. We call this primal tracker agent dual-DST. Experimental results on MultiWOZ2.1 dataset show that the proposed dual-DST works very well, especially when labelled data is limited. It achieves comparable performance to the system where labeled data is fully used."

The existing HMTC algorithms largely focus on the design of classifiers, such as the local, global, or a combination of them. However, very few studies have focused on hierarchical feature extraction and explore the association between the hierarchical labels and the text. In this paper, we propose a Label-based Attention for Hierarchical Mutlti-label Text Classification Neural Network  , where the novel label-based attention module is designed to hierarchically extract important information from the text based on the labels from different hierarchy levels. Besides, hierarchical information is shared across levels while preserving the hierarchical label-based information. Separate local and global document embeddings are obtained and used to facilitate the respective local and global classifications. In our experiments, LA-HCN outperforms other state-of-the-art neural network-based HMTC algorithms on four public HMTC datasets. The ablation study also demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed label-based attention module as well as the novel local and global embeddings and classifications. By visualizing the learned attention , we find that LA-HCN is able to extract meaningful information corresponding to the different labels which provides explainability that may be helpful for the human analyst."

In each iteration, encoding the partially edited text, Recurrence decodes the latent representation, generates an action of short, fixed-length, and applies the action to complete a single edit. For a comprehensive comparison, we introduce three types of text editing tasks: Arithmetic Operators Restoration , Arithmetic Equation Simplification , Arithmetic Equation Correction . Extensive experiments on these tasks with varying difficulties demonstrate that Recurrence achieves improvements over conventional inference methods."

Experiments then showed that LSTM language models trained on natural English text learn to approximate this theoretical distribution. Further, we found that explicitly imposing the theoretical distribution upon the model during training yielded better language model perplexity overall, with particular improvements for predicting low-frequency  words.

These users are expected to raise either a straightforward question with a Yes/No answer or a challenging question that requires a detailed and descriptive answer. The existing techniques in VQA-Med fail to distinguish between the different question types sometimes complicates the simpler problems, or over-simplifies the complicated ones. It is certainly true that for different question types, several distinct systems can lead to confusion and discomfort for the end-users. To address this issue, we propose a hierarchical deep multi-modal network that analyzes and classifies end-user questions/queries and then incorporates a query-specific approach for answer prediction. We refer our proposed approach as Hierarchical Question Segregation based Visual Question Answering, in short HQS-VQA.      %   We first use the Support Vector Machine  with the hand-engineered features to classify the questions into yes/no and descriptive types.    % Then, based on the question types, we employ different strategies to provide the answer. The Yes/No type questions are treated as a binary classification problem. We generate the answer from a fixed vocabulary for the descriptive type question.     Our contributions are three-fold, viz. firstly, we propose a question segregation  technique for VQA-Med; secondly, we integrate the QS model to the hierarchical deep multi-modal neural network to generate proper answers to the queries related to medical images; and thirdly, we study the impact of QS in Medical-VQA by comparing the performance of the proposed model with QS and a model without QS. We evaluate the performance of our proposed model on two benchmark datasets, viz. RAD and CLEF18. Experimental results show that our proposed HQS-VQA technique outperforms the baseline models with significant margins.

"In recent years, Transformers defined state-of-the-art performance variety NLP tasks, including machine translation language modeling. While large Transformer models learn uniquely rich representations, also highly overparameterized . Several studies therefore attempted prune Transformers training retaining much performance possible . Some methods fairly successful, achieving compression ratios 10 depending downstream task. Looking beyond task performance, however, remains unclear widely-used pruning methods affect model's learned representations. For example, pruned Transformer may translate text BLEU, pruning affect model ways unaccounted metric? Motivated question, apply recent analysis techniques study representations increasingly sparse Transformers trained MT. We perform magnitude pruning iterative, lottery-ticket fashion identify Transformers competitive sparsities drop task performance . We examine internal structures models sparsity increases, specifically addressing following questions: Using iterative magnitude pruning , train En-De Transformer retains 99.4\% BLEU 66.4\% sparsity. During IMP, obtain eight Transformer models varying levels sparsity, along original unpruned model. We probe models' representations learned linguistic knowledge eighteen auxiliary syntactic semantic tasks . We perform unsupervised comparison representations attention distributions dense sparse models, adopting metrics posed \citet{wu_similarity_2020}. Our key conclusions follows: We introduce energy-based re-ranking improve performance autoregressive neural machine translation. Still, performance gap output EBR oracle re-ranker significant.

However, it is unclear how such pruning techniques affect a model's learned representations. By probing Transformers with more and more low-magnitude weights pruned away, we find that complex semantic information is first to be degraded. Analysis of internal activations reveals that higher layers diverge most over the course of pruning, gradually becoming less complex than their dense counterparts. Meanwhile, early layers of sparse models begin to perform more encoding. Attention mechanisms remain remarkably consistent as sparsity increases."

Our probing results find lower layers sparse models directly encode POS syntax information compared dense models, even though performance final encoder representations similar . Moreover, similarity analyses conclude early layer encoder hidden representations attention distributions trend closer towards respective final representations sparse models. Information-theoretically, sparse layers less maximum capacity encoding, individual layer must shoulder load final representations remain predictively salient. Conversely, overparameterized dense model compensate weak lower layer representations upper layers. Indeed, upper FC layers pruned lower FC layers , reflecting shift modeling power away higher layers. We also observe gradual loss information stored model representations weights pruned, especially later layers. Individual neurons diverge dense counterparts , causing drop overall representational complexity encoder decoder. Correspondingly, sparse models perform worse higher-order semantic tasks less relevant BLEU . The reduced overall complexity sparse representations may partially explain final layers observed closer early layers . Finally, find sparse models' attention distributions remain largely similar values dense model. This ability reduce weights attention modules maintaining nearly identical representations affirms lines work . Of three attention types, encoder-decoder pruned least , varies across sparsities, exhibits within-model, inter-layer heterogeneity . These results corroborate existing evidence unique importance . Meanwhile, decoder self-attention extremely homogenous across layers sparsities, perhaps encoder-decoder attention relevant creating rich representations. \paragraph{Limitations.} Our work focuses pruned Transformers BLEU remains similar original model. However, BLEU imperfect measure translation quality , possible pruned models actually perform worse task lower sparsities suggested BLEU. Still, think work relevant given sparse models typically held standard matching unpruned task performance. Next, emphasize work focuses solely magnitude pruning, may representative pruning methods impact Transformers. We chose style pruning primarily allows higher overall sparsity without drop performance . Further, might expected pruning entire neurons attention heads would substantially change e.g.~the distributions model's outputs, found less existing work specifically measuring effects magnitude pruning. This dearth analysis seemed particularly egregious given recent growth work unstructured sparsity . Finally, note probing classifiers: widely discussed community , probes measure correlation model outputs auxilliary information. Differences probe performance necessarily imply anything information actually uses forward pass. Especially since find evidence suggesting sparse models may encoding information across layers, possible differing structure may explain worse probe performance, opposed fundamentally weaker linguistic feature extraction. We hope future work supplements results analyzing model's encoded knowledge ways. \section{Conclusions} We evaluate unstructured pruning affects behavior Transformers task performance maintained. We use probing classifiers demonstrate pruning degrades semantic knowledge affecting BLEU, early layers sparse models better encode low-level linguistic information. Unsupervised similarity analysis reveals pruning induces representational changes encoder decoder, particularly higher layers, early sparse representations similar final representations.

This task is typically casted as a supervised text matching problem. Supervised learning is powerful when the labeled data is sufficient. However, on online recruitment platforms, job-resume interaction data is sparse and noisy, which affects the performance of job-resume match algorithms.  \ignore{This task is typically casted as a supervised text matching problem.While supervised learning is powerful when the labeled data is sufficient and clean, the job-resume interaction in practice is usually sparse and noisy, which brings difficulties to effective text representation learning.}  To alleviate these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel multi-view co-teaching network from sparse interaction data for job-resume matching.  Our network consists of two major components, namely text-based matching model and relation-based matching model.  The two parts capture semantic compatibility in two different views, and complement each other.  In order to address the challenges from sparse and noisy data, we design two specific  strategies  to combine the two components. First, two components share the learned parameters or representations, so that the original representations of each component can be enhanced. More importantly, we adopt a co-teaching mechanism to reduce the influence of noise in training data. The core idea is to let the two components help each other by selecting more reliable training instances. The two strategies focus on representation enhancement and data enhancement, respectively.  Compared with pure text-based matching models, the proposed approach is able to learn better data representations from limited or even sparse interaction data, which is more resistible to noise in training data.  Experiment results have demonstrated that our model is able to outperform state-of-the-art methods for job-resume matching.  %In such a way, compared with pure text-based match models, the proposed approach is able to learn better representations from limited or even sparse interaction data, and is more resistible to noise in training data."

Notable examples RBMT systems original, rule-based Systran , Lucy LT Apertium platform . Instead, corpus-based machine translation systems learn translate examples, usually form sentence-level aligned corpora. On one hand, approach generally computationally expensive offers limited control generated translations. Furthermore, feasible language pairs limited available parallel resources.

During analysis phase, source sentence morphologically analysed using lexicon identifies surface form plausible morphological readings. Next, Lucy LT chart parser together analysis grammar consisting augmented syntactic rules extracts underlying syntax tree structure annotates it. The transfer generation grammars applied succession tree, undergoes multiple annotations transformations add information equivalences target language adapt source language structures appropriate ones target language.

A named entity word sequence words unequivocally refer real-world object, proper nouns, toponyms, numbers dates. In context MT, NEs present different challenges. For example, English sentence starts word Smith, know priori dealing name profession, translated, proper noun may left untranslated, maybe transliterated different script. A second issue may arise using subword units: word-level models may accidentally preserve out-of-vocabulary NE, subword level model generate translation it. NEs one main out-of-vocabulary word classes, often cause translation problems seriously affect meaning sentence . Similarly, terminological expression consist single word sequence words may different meaning depending context domain appear. Hence, translation term might different depending context domain. Moreover, different contexts domains may impose additional restrictions language used, different modes use active passive voice, presence particular terminology may suggest translation acceptable even meaning source sentence preserved. Accurate terminology translation crucial produce adequate translations .

While this approach grants extensive control over the output of the system, the cost of formalising the needed linguistic knowledge is much higher than training a corpus-based system, where a machine learning approach is used to automatically learn to translate from examples. In this paper, we describe different approaches to leverage the information contained in rule-based machine translation systems to improve a corpus-based one, namely, a neural machine translation model, with a focus on a low-resource scenario. Three different kinds of information were used: morphological information, named entities and terminology. In addition to evaluating the general performance of the system, we systematically analysed the performance of the proposed approaches when dealing with the targeted phenomena. Our results suggest that the proposed models have limited ability to learn from external information, and most approaches do not significantly alter the results of the automatic evaluation, but our preliminary qualitative evaluation shows that in certain cases the hypothesis generated by our system exhibit favourable behaviour such as keeping the use of passive voice. %Our results suggest that adding morphological information to the source language is as effective as using subword units in this particular setting."

The resulting model does not require any DST or template responses, nor the KB as input, and it can dynamically update its KB via fine-tuning. We evaluate our solution in five task-oriented dialogue datasets with small, medium, and large KB size. Our experiments show that end-to-end models can effectively embed knowledge bases in their parameters and achieve competitive performance in all evaluated datasets\footnote{Code available in \url{https://github.com/HLTCHKUST/ke-dialogue}}. % The resulting model do not access any external resource during the user interaction, and do not require any KB as input. % to learn to embed structured knowledge of any size directly with model parameters. % % We propose to fine-tune large pre-trained models for task-oriented dialog system with our approach to learning task-specific structured knowledge.   %This has the advantage of  as part of the input nor as an external source during the user interaction."
"Open domain question answering~ involves finding answers questions open corpus. The task led growing interest scalable end-to-end retrieval systems question answering. Recent neural retrieval models shown rapid improvements, surpassing traditional information retrieval~ methods BM25. When QA formulated reading comprehension task, cross-attention models like BERT achieved better-than-human performance benchmarks Stanford Question Answering Dataset . Cross-attention models especially well suited problems involving comparisons paired textual inputs, provide early fusion fine-grained information within pair. This encourages careful comparison integration details across within two texts. However, early fusion across questions answers poor fit retrieval, since prevents pre-computation answer representations. Rather, neural retrieval models independently compute embeddings questions answers typically using dual encoders fast scalable search. Using dual encoders results late fusion within shared embedding space. For machine reading, early fusion using cross-attention introduces inductive bias compare fine grained text spans within questions answers. This inductive bias missing single dot-product based scoring operation dual encoder retrieval models. Without equivalent inductive bias, late fusion expected require additional training data learn necessary representations fine grained comparisons. To support learning improved representations retrieval, explore supervised data augmentation approach leveraging complex classification model cross-attention question-answer pairs. Given gold question passage pairs, first train cross-attention classification model supervisor. Then collection questions used mine potential question passage pairs supervision cross-attention model.

In paper, propose learn KB directly model parameters using novel Knowledge Embedded approach, fundamentally different giving KB input using DST querying KB. We demonstrate approach scalable different KB sizes used dynamically changing KBs via fine-tuning. Automatic human evaluations confirm models embedded KBs achieve competitive performance evaluated datasets. Finally show, first time, end-to-end models perform well pipelined modularized systems MWoZ single domain dataset."," Neural models that independently project questions and answers into a shared embedding space allow for efficient continuous space retrieval from large corpora. Independently computing embeddings for questions and answers results in late fusion of information related to matching questions to their answers. While critical for efficient retrieval, late fusion underperforms models that make use of early fusion . We present a supervised data mining method using an accurate early fusion model to improve the training of an efficient late fusion retrieval model. We first train an accurate classification model with cross-attention between questions and answers. The accurate cross-attention model is then used to annotate additional passages in order to generate weighted training examples for a neural retrieval model. The resulting retrieval model with additional data significantly outperforms retrieval models directly trained with gold annotations on Precision at $N$  and Mean Reciprocal Rank ."
"Topic models, Latent Dirichlet Allocation , aim discover underlying topics semantic structures text collections. Due interpretability effectiveness, LDA extended many Natural Language Processing tasks . Most models employ mean-field variational inference collapsed Gibbs sampling model inference result intractable posteriors. However, inference algorithms model specific require dedicated derivations. To address limitation, neural topic models black-box inference explored, flexible training schemes. Inspired variational autoencoder , \citet{miao2016nvdm} proposed Neural Variational Document Model interprets latent code VAE topics. Following way, \citet{srivastava2017prodlda} adopted logistic normal prior rather Gaussian mimic simplex properties topic distribution. Logistic normal Laplace approximation Dirichlet distribution . However, logistic normal exhibit multiple peaks vertices simplex Dirichlet distribution. Therefore, less capable capturing multi-modality crucial topic modeling . To overcome limitation, \citet{wang2019atm} proposed Adversarial-neural Topic Model , topic model based Generative Adversarial Networks sampling topics directly Dirichlet distribution impose Dirichlet prior. ATM employs generator transforming randomly sampled topic distributions word distributions, adversarially trained discriminator estimating probability word distribution came training data rather generator. Although ATM shown effective discovering coherent topics, used induce topic distribution given document due absence topic inference module. Such limitation hinders application downstream tasks, text classification. Moreover, ATM fails deal document labels help extract coherent topics. For example, document labeled `sports' likely belongs topics `basketball' `football' rather `economics' `politics'. To address limitations ATM, propose novel neural topic modeling approach, named Topic Modeling Cycle-consistent Adversarial Training . In ToMCAT, topic modeling cast transformation topic distributions word distributions. Specifically, transformation topic distributions word distributions used interpret topics, reverse transformation used infer underlying topics given document. Under formulation, ToMCAT employs generator transform topic distributions randomly sampled Dirichlet prior corresponding word distributions, encoder reversely transform documents represented word distributions topic distributions. To encourage generator/encoder produce realistic target samples, discriminators word/topic distributions introduced enable adversarial training. Additional cycle-consistency constraints utilized align learning encoder generator prevent contradicting other. Furthermore, documents labels, propose sToMCAT introduces extra classifier regularize topic modeling process.

With strong general purpose cross-attention model, supervised data mining method could modified train in-domain retrieval models without gold question answer pairs. We leave direction future work.","   Advances on deep generative models have attracted significant research interest in neural topic modeling.   The recently proposed Adversarial-neural Topic Model models topics with   an adversarially trained generator network   and employs Dirichlet prior to capture the semantic patterns in latent topics.   It is effective in discovering coherent topics but unable to infer topic distributions for given documents   or utilize available document labels.   To overcome such limitations, we propose Topic Modeling with Cycle-consistent Adversarial Training    and its supervised version sToMCAT.   ToMCAT employs a generator network to interpret topics and an encoder network to infer document topics.   Adversarial training and cycle-consistent constraints are used to   encourage the generator and the encoder to produce realistic samples that coordinate with each other.   sToMCAT extends ToMCAT by incorporating document labels   into the topic modeling process to help discover more coherent topics.   The effectiveness of the proposed models is evaluated on unsupervised/supervised topic modeling and   text classification.   The experimental results show that our models can produce both coherent and informative topics,   outperforming a number of competitive baselines."
"Probabilistic topic models tools discovering main themes large corpora.

For example, GraphBTM neural topic model incorporates graph representation document capture biterm co-occurrences document. To construct graph, sliding window document employed word pairs window connected. A limitation GraphBTM word relationships considered ignoring document relationships. Since topic possessed subset documents corpus, believe topical neighborhood document, i.e., documents similar topics, would help determine topics document.

In this paper, we propose Graph Topic Model , a GNN based neural topic model   that represents a corpus as a document relationship graph.   Documents and words in the corpus become nodes in the graph and   are connected based on document-word co-occurrences.   By introducing the graph structure,   the relationships between documents are established through their shared words   and thus the topical representation of a document is enriched by   aggregating information from its neighboring nodes using graph convolution.   Extensive experiments on three datasets were conducted   and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

We show that incorporating silver-standard RST features can increase accuracy when classifying coherence. We demonstrate this through our tree-recursive neural model, namely RST-Recursive, which takes advantage of the text's RST features produced by a state of the art RST parser. We evaluate our approach on the Grammarly Corpus for Discourse Coherence  and show that when ensembled with the current state of the art, we can achieve the new state of the art accuracy on this benchmark. Furthermore, when deployed alone, RST-Recursive achieves competitive accuracy while having 62\% fewer parameters.  %This paper explores the impact of silver-standard Rhetorical Structure Theory  trees and relations on discourse coherence evaluation. We show that incorporating discourse features benefits the previous state of the art model and also propose three models based on Recursive Neural Networks. We evaluate our models on the Grammarly Corpus for Discourse Coherence , showing promising results with one model achieving new state of the art performance on discourse classification, and another nearing previous state of the art accuracy. In addition, we provide valuable insights with respect to the application and behaviour of RST relations and trees in discourse analysis, and motivate future work in this area."
"Medical code assignment categorizes clinical documents sets codes facilitate hospital management improve health record searching~. These clinical texts comprise physiological signals, laboratory tests, physician notes, International Classification Diseases coding system widely used annotation. Most hospitals rely manual coding human coders assign standard diagnosis codes discharge summaries billing purposes. However, work error-prone~. Incorrect coding cause billing mistakes mislead general practitioners patients readmitted. Intelligent automated coding systems could act recommendation system help coders allocate correct medical codes clinical notes. Automatic medical code assignment intensively researched past decades~. Recent advances natural language processing deep learning techniques inspired many methods automatic medical code assignment~. \citet{zhang2019learning} incorporated structured knowledge medical text representations preserving translational property concept embeddings. However, several challenges remain medical text understanding. Diagnosis notes contain complex diagnosis information, includes large number professional medical vocabulary noisy information non-standard synonyms misspellings. Free text clinical notes lengthy documents, usually hundreds thousands tokens. Thus, medical text understanding requires effective feature representation learning complex cognitive process enable multiple diagnosis code assignment. Previous neural methods medical text encoding generally fall two categories. Medical text modeling commonly regarded synonym recurrent neural networks capture sequential dependency. Such works include AttentiveLSTM~, Bi-GRU~ HA-GRU~. The category uses convolutional neural networks CAML~ MultiResCNN~. These methods capture locality achieved optimal predictive performance medical code assignment. Inspired generic temporal convolutional network architecture~, consider medical text modeling causal constraints, encoding current token depends previous tokens, using dilated convolutional network. We combine label attention network fine-grained information aggregation. \paragraph{Distinction Our Model} The MultiResNet currently state-of-the-art model. It applies multi-channel CNN different filters learn features concatenates features produce final prediction. In contrast, model extends TCN sequence modeling uses single filter dilation operation control receptive field. In addition, instead weight tying used TCN, customize label attention pooling extract relevant rich features. \paragraph{Our Contributions} We contribute literature three ways. We consider medical text modeling perspective imposing sequential causal constraint medical code assignment using dilated convolutions, effectively captures long sequential dependencies learns contextual representations long clinical notes. We propose dilated convolutional attention network , coupling residual dilated convolution, label attention network effective efficient medical text modeling. Experiments real-world medical data show improvement state art. Compared multi-channel CNN RNN models, model also offers smaller computational cost. In paper, explore usefulness silver-standard parsed RST features neural coherence classification. We propose two new methods, RST-Recursive Ensemble. The former achieves reasonably good performance, 2\ short state art, robust 62\ fewer parameters. The latter demonstrates added advantage RST features improving classification accuracy existing state art methods setting new state art performance modest promising margin. This signifies document's rhetorical structure important aspect perceived clarity. Naturally, improvement performance bounded quality parsed RST features could increase better discourse parsers developed. In future, exploring RST-based architectures coherence classification, well better RST ensemble schemes improving RST parsing avenues potentially fruitful research. Additional research multipronged approaches draw Centering Theory, RST deep learning together also value."," Medical code assignment, which predicts medical codes from clinical texts, is a fundamental task of intelligent medical information systems. The emergence of deep models in natural language processing has boosted the development of automatic assignment methods.  However, recent advanced neural architectures with flat convolutions or multi-channel feature concatenation ignore the sequential causal constraint within a text sequence and may not learn meaningful clinical text representations, especially for lengthy clinical notes with long-term sequential dependency. This paper proposes a Dilated Convolutional Attention Network , integrating dilated convolutions, residual connections, and label attention, for medical code assignment. It adopts dilated convolutions to capture complex medical patterns with a receptive field which increases exponentially with dilation size. Experiments on a real-world clinical dataset empirically show that our model improves the state of the art."
"The Transformer translation model , outperformed previous RNN/CNN based sequence-to-sequence models, based multi-head attention networks. The multi-head attention mechanism, computes several scaled dot-product attention parallel, efficiently parallelized sequence level RNNs , addressing drawback CNNs model contexts inside fixed window. Even though advantages parallelization multi-head attention mechanism, recent studies suggest computation scaled dot-product attention sufficiently efficient, especially handling long sequences, due quadratic increasing size attention matrix. In paper, study accelerate inference scaled dot-product attention another perspective. Specifically, propose learn hard retrieval attention attends one position sequence rather tokens simplify computation scaled dot-product attention. Since hard attention mechanism attends one token, matrix multiplication attention probabilities value sequence standard scaled dot-product attention achieved simple efficient retrieval operation. Our contributions follows: Recent years extensively studies automatic medical code assignment. Neural clinical text encoding models use CNNs extract local features RNNs preserve sequential dependency. This paper combines using dilated convolution. The dilated convolutional attention network consists dilated convolution layers, residual connections, label attention layer. The DCAN model obeys causal constraint sequence encoding learns rich representations capture label-aware importance. Through experiments MIMIC-III dataset, model shows better predictive performance state-of-the-art methods."," The Transformer translation model that based on the multi-head attention mechanism can be parallelized easily and lead to competitive performance in machine translation. The multi-head attention network performs the scaled dot-product attention function in parallel, empowering the model by jointly attending to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. Though its advantages in parallelization, many previous works suggest the computation of the attention mechanism is not sufficiently efficient, especially when processing long sequences, and propose approaches to improve its efficiency with long sentences. In this paper, we accelerate the inference of the scaled dot-product attention in another perspective. Specifically, instead of squeezing the sequence to attend, we simplify the computation of the scaled dot-product attention by learning a hard retrieval attention which only attends to one token in the sentence rather than all tokens. Since the hard attention mechanism only attends to one position, the matrix multiplication between attention probabilities and the value sequence in the standard scaled dot-product attention can be replaced by a simple and efficient retrieval operation. As a result, our hard retrieval attention mechanism can empirically accelerate the scaled dot-product attention for both long and short sequences by $66.5\%$, while performing competitively in a wide range of machine translation tasks when using for cross attention networks."
"Neural Machine Translation opened new opportunities transfer learning high-resource low-resource language pairs . While transfer learning shown great promise, transfer languages different scripts brings additional challenges. For successful transfer embedding layer, parent child model use partially overlapping vocabulary . It common merge two vocabularies aligning identical subwords randomly assigning remaining subwords child vocabulary positions parent vocabulary . This works well transfer languages use script, child language written unseen script, vocabulary positions replaced random subwords. This significantly reduces transfer embedding layer. \citet{gheini2019universal} argue romanization improve transfer languages unseen scripts. However, romanization also introduce information loss might hurt translation quality. In work, study usefulness romanization transfer many-to-many multilingual MT models low-resource languages different scripts. Our contributions following: We propose accelerate inference scaled dot-product attention learning hard retrieval attention attends one token sentence rather tokens. With one-on-one hard attention matrix, matrix multiplication attention probabilities value sequence standard scaled dot-product attention replaced simple efficient retrieval operation. Our hard retrieval attention mechanism accelerate long short sequences times fast scaled dot-product attention. In experiments wide range machine translation tasks, demonstrate using hard retrieval attention cross attention networks lead competitive performance."," Transfer learning is a popular strategy to improve the quality of low-resource machine translation. For an optimal transfer of the embedding layer, the child and parent model should share a substantial part of the vocabulary.   This is not the case when transferring to languages with a different script. We explore the benefit of romanization in this scenario. Our results show that romanization entails information loss and is thus not always superior to simpler vocabulary transfer methods, but can improve the transfer between related languages with different scripts. We compare two romanization tools and find that they exhibit different degrees of information loss, which affects translation quality. Finally, we extend romanization to the target side, showing that this can be a successful strategy when coupled with a simple deromanization model."

Given triplet data record, visual interaction labeler, label assigned, want framework effectively synthesize propose labeling rules labeler choose from. Finally, want framework optimally aggregate chosen rules order create labeled training set probabilistic labels order subsequently train discriminative models it. \stitle{Framework Overview} The data programming demonstration framework two input sources: human labeler, data labeled. The labeler subject matter expert sufficient domain understanding extract useful signals data. Given dataset, framework enables labeler label record categorical label, providing labeling rationales interactively marking relevant parts record specifying semantics relationships among them. The output labeling model, trained automatically produce labels large set unlabeled data. The DPBD framework four main components, labeling interface, synthesizer, modeler, active sampler. The labeler interacts data via labeling interface. The labeling interface records labeler's interaction compiles interaction labeling rule. The synthesizer synthesizes labeling rules translates chosen labeler program functions. Third, selected functions passed modeler, builds labeling model optimally aggregating generated functions. Until certain stopping criterion met labeler decides exit, active sampler selects next data record present labeler. In rest section, describe details component. The labeling interface workplace labeler encodes domain knowledge labeling rules. It provides way express noisy explanations labeling decisions using visual interaction language, allows user express domain knowledge without formalize ideas computer programs natural language explanations. This allows focus patterns data abstracting away implementation concerns. \stitle{Generalized Labeling Model} Inspired entity-relationship model database modeling, generalized labeling model models data records concepts relationships. The GLM views data record series tokens, token continuous subset record semantics attached. For example, text data, token span data record; image data record, would 2D region, rectangular free form; audio data record, would 1D window data record . A concept group tokens labeler believes share common semantics. For instance, text data, labeler might define concept positive adjectives consisting set tokens, imply positive review. When labeling audio data, labeler might create concept aggregate clips express excitement, specific speaker. This abstraction allows user teach GLM generalizations relevant task. A relationship represents binary correlation token-token, token-concept, concept-concept. Some examples membership , co-existence , positional . \stitle{Mapping GLM Elements Operations} Given GLM specification described above, framework also defines operations applied GLM elements. Table lists GLM elements corresponding operations. The implementation labeling interface operations described Table would vary across data types token definitions. To add expressivity, GLM may also perform transformations set tokens, describe next section. \stitle{Compiling Operations Labeling Rules} Once labeler finishes annotating example using provided operations, selects label, tokens extracted annotation used initial set conditions build rules. The synthesizer combines conditions labeling rules selecting subsets conditions combined different conjunctive formulas, according relationships user annotated. The synthesizer extends initial set labeling rules presents extended labeling rules labeler select from, choosing desired ones based domain knowledge. A labeling rule serves intermediate language, interpretable labeler synthesizer. In framework, adopt notation domain relational calculus represent rules, expressed as: . The variable \texttt{tokens} sequence tokens existential quantification, \texttt{conditions} conjunctive formula boolean predicates tested \texttt{tokens} data record. The predicates first-order expressions, expressed tuple . optional transformation function token identifier, process mapping raw token generalized forms. Some example transformations word lemmatization text labeling, speech-to-text detection audio labeling, object recognition image labeling. token, either token, literal set. If denotes token, transformation function may also apply . operator whose type depends type . If token literal, detects positional equality relationship. Otherwise, set, one set operators . Since \texttt{conditions} conjunctive form, order labeler's interactions matter. \example{ Consider following review binary sentiment classification task: \texttt{This book great! I loved read many times I soon buy new copy.} If labeler thinks data record positive sentiment, express decision rationale using GLM. First, may select two tokens related sentiment: \texttt{book} \texttt{great}. Assume two concepts labeler previously created: \texttt{itembook, electronics}; \texttt{padjwonderful}. The labeler realizes token \texttt{great} generalized \texttt{padj} concept, means labeling rule still valid token replaced tokens concept, adds token concept. Finally, labeler creates positional relationship \texttt{book} token \texttt{great} indicate appear sentence, completing labeling process. These operations compile labeling rule . } This rule sent synthesizer expansion program synthesis. Given compiled labeling rule labeling interface, synthesizer extends one single labeling rule labeler's interaction set general labeling rules; translates labeling rules computer programs. It straightforward translate rules executable computer programs , section, focus synthesize extended labeling rules. Given labeling rule compiled labeler's interaction, synthesizer generates labeling rules optimizing two competing goals: maximizing generalization, data accurately labeled; maximizing coverage labeler's interaction, simply labeler's interaction valuable signal labeling based domain knowledge. Of course, larger set annotations interaction, larger set labeling functions synthesized. To keep rule selection easy possible user, case prioritize rules cover interaction, assuming little redundancy. labeler's interaction. We achieve generalization given rules using following heuristics: substituting tokens concepts; replacing general coexistence relationships position-specific ones; applying available transformations tokens . Since labeling rule GLM conjunctive conditions, Algorithm generalizes predicate conditions. Inside, Line Line substitute token concept. Line implemented explicitly matching token concept set, well sophisticated data-dependent processing via transformation . For example, system text labeling , addition matching values labeler defined concepts, also apply named-entity recognition named-entities implicit concepts token member of. Line Line replace positional co-occurrence relationship removing condition specifies positional context.

Given triplet data record, visual interaction labeler, label assigned, want framework effectively synthesize propose labeling rules labeler choose from. Finally, want framework optimally aggregate chosen rules order create labeled training set probabilistic labels order subsequently train discriminative models it. \stitle{Framework Overview} The data programming demonstration framework two input sources: human labeler, data labeled. The labeler subject matter expert sufficient domain understanding extract useful signals data. Given dataset, framework enables labeler label record categorical label, providing labeling rationales interactively marking relevant parts record specifying semantics relationships among them. The output labeling model, trained automatically produce labels large set unlabeled data. Inherited traditional data programming~, framework also assumes set labeled data available tuning model hyperparameters. The DPBD framework four main components. The labeler interacts data via labeling interface. The labeling interface records labeler's interaction compiles interaction labeling rule. The synthesizer synthesizes labeling rules translates chosen labeler program functions. Third, selected functions passed modeler, builds labeling model optimally aggregating generated functions. Until certain stopping criterion met labeler decides exit, active sampler selects next data record present labeler. In rest section, describe details component. The labeling interface workplace labeler encodes domain knowledge labeling rules. It provides way express noisy explanations labeling decisions using visual interaction language, allows user express domain knowledge without formalize ideas computer programs natural language explanations. This allows focus patterns data abstracting away implementation concerns. Inspired entity-relationship model database modeling, generalized labeling model models data records concepts relationships. The GLM views data record series tokens, token continuous subset record semantics attached. For example, text data, token span data record; image data record, would 2D region, rectangular free form; audio data record, would 1D window data record . A concept group tokens labeler believes share common semantics. For instance, text data, labeler might define concept positive adjectives consisting set tokens, imply positive review. When labeling audio data, labeler might create concept aggregate clips express excitement, specific speaker. This abstraction allows user teach GLM generalizations relevant task. A relationship represents binary correlation token-token, token-concept, concept-concept. Some examples membership , co-existence , positional . \subhead{Mapping GLM Elements Operations} Given GLM specification described above, framework also defines operations applied GLM elements. Table lists GLM elements corresponding operations. The implementation labeling interface operations described Table would vary across data types token definitions. To add expressivity, GLM may also perform transformations set tokens, describe next section. \subhead{Compiling Operations Labeling Rules} Once labeler finishes annotating example using provided operations, selects label, tokens extracted annotation used initial set conditions build rules. The synthesizer combines conditions labeling rules selecting subsets conditions combined different conjunctive formulas, according relationships user annotated. The synthesizer extends initial set labeling rules presents extended labeling rules labeler select from, choosing desired ones based domain knowledge. A labeling rule serves intermediate language, interpretable labeler synthesizer. In framework, adapt notation domain relational calculus represent rules, expressed as: . The variable \texttt{tokens} sequence tokens existential quantification, \texttt{conditions} conjunctive formula boolean predicates tested \texttt{tokens} data record. The predicates first-order expressions, expressed tuple . optional transformation function token identifier, process mapping raw token generalized forms. Some example transformations word lemmatization text labeling, speech-to-text detection audio labeling, object recognition image labeling. token, either token, literal set. If denotes token, transformation function may also apply . operator whose type depends type . If token literal, detects positional equality relationship. Otherwise, set, one set operators . Since \texttt{conditions} conjunctive form, order labeler's interactions matter. \example{ Consider binary sentiment classification task Amazon review data. Observe following review: \texttt{This book great! I loved read many times I soon buy new copy.} If labeler thinks data record positive sentiment, express decision rationale using GLM. First, may select two tokens related sentiment: \texttt{book} \texttt{great}. Assume two concepts labeler previously created: \texttt{itembook, electronics}; \texttt{padjwonderful}. The labeler realizes token \texttt{great} generalized \texttt{padj} concept, means labeling rule still valid token replaced tokens concept, adds token concept. Finally, labeler creates positional relationship \texttt{book} token \texttt{great} indicate appear sentence, completing labeling process. These operations compile labeling rule . } This rule sent synthesizer expansion program synthesis. Given compiled labeling rule labeling interface, synthesizer extends one single labeling rule labeler's interaction set general labeling rules; translates labeling rules computer programs. It straightforward translate rules executable computer programs , section, focus synthesize extended labeling rules. Given labeling rule compiled labeler's interaction, synthesizer generates labeling rules optimizing two competing goals: maximizing generalization, data accurately labeled; maximizing coverage labeler's interaction, simply labeler's interaction valuable signal labeling based domain knowledge. Of course, larger set annotations interaction, larger set labeling functions synthesized. To keep rule selection easy possible user, case prioritize rules cover interaction, assuming little redundancy. labeler's interaction. We achieve generalization given rules using following heuristics: substituting tokens concepts; replacing general co-existence relationships position-specific ones; applying available transformations tokens . Since labeling rule GLM conjunctive conditions, Algorithm generalizes predicate conditions. Inside, Line Line substitute token concept. Line implemented explicitly matching token concept set, well sophisticated data-dependent processing via transformation . For example, system text labeling , addition matching values labeler defined concepts, also apply named-entity recognition named-entities implicit concepts token member of. Line Line replace positional co-occurrence relationship removing condition specifies positional context. The conditions extended labeling rules conjunctive combination single predicates, one extended condition set . In addition, special case binary labeling, algorithm also considers rule flips label adding negation conditions . Once extended rules generated, rules ranked generalization score---a measurement applicable certain rule is. We define data-independent generalization score labeling rule as: . Intuitively, calculated counting many different data instances used. It prefers labeling rules using large sets match tokens data record. \example{ Continuing Amazon review example, synthesizer derive following labeling rules using heuristics: Labeling rule~ generated using heuristics . Labeling rule~ and~ synthesized using heuristics , respectively. Note labeling rule~ general than~ and~ data records labeled by~ and~ labeled way using labeling rule~. Labeling rules~ due flipping binary label heuristics . } Once extended labeling rules generated, labeler help confirm validity order achieve faster convergence. The top-k candidates ranked generalization score displayed labeling interface labeler accept reject. The modeler component trains model used automatically annotate unlabeled datasets. Naively aggregating labeling functions either inaccurate , scale large set unlabeled data. This simply labeling functions noisy: may overlap, conflict even depends other, provide limited signals weak supervision. Instead, modeler encapsulates ideas traditional data programming first build generative model denoise labeling functions, train discriminative model leverage features beyond expressed labeling functions. To improve model quality faster rates, framework uses active sampler choose next data record labeling. The active sampler plug custom active learning policy. By default, selects data record highest entropy : probability example belongs class , predicted trained label model. \section{Introduction} Machine learning models used practice today predominantly supervised models rely large datasets labeled training. However, cost collecting maintaining labeled training data remains bottleneck training high-capacity supervised models. Data programming aims address difficulty collecting labeled data using programmatic approach weak supervision heuristics, domain experts expected provide data programs incorporating domain knowledge. Prior work data programming focuses modeling aggregating labeling functions written manually generated automatically denoise labeling functions. However, little known user experience writing labeling functions improve it. Writing data programs be, however, challenging time consuming. Most domain experts lay users little programming literacy, even proficient programmers, often difficult convert domain knowledge set rules writing programs. By extending data programming programming example, bridge gap scalable training data generation domain experts. To address challenges, introduce data programming demonstration , new framework aims make creating labeling functions easier learning users' interactive visual demonstrations. DPBD moves burden writing labeling functions intelligent synthesizer enabling users steer synthesis process multiple semantic levels, providing rationales relevant labeling choices interactively filtering proposed functions. DPBD draws two lines prior research; programming demonstration example , e.g.,, aims make programming easier synthesizing based user interactions input output examples, interactive learning user-provided features rationales . We operationalize framework \system, interactive system enables accessible data programming create labeled training datasets document classification. \system automatically generates document level labeling rules span-level annotations relations specific examples provided users. Through user study conducted 10 data scientists, evaluate \system alongside manual data programming using Snorkel. We measure predictive performances models created participants two common labeling tasks, sentiment classification spam detection. We also elicit ratings qualitative feedback participants multiple measures, including ease use, ease learning, expressivity, overall satisfaction. We find \system facilitates accessible creation labeling functions without loss quality learned labeling models.

This is not scalable to complex, realistic environments with new unexpected changes.      Humans can perform fast incremental learning on the fly and memory systems in the brain play a critical role.     We introduce Sparse Meta Networks -- a meta-learning approach to learn online sequential adaptation algorithms for deep neural networks, by using deep neural networks.      We augment a deep neural network with a layer-specific fast-weight memory. The fast-weights are generated sparsely at each time step and accumulated incrementally through time providing a useful inductive bias for online continual adaptation. We demonstrate strong performance on a variety of sequential adaptation scenarios, from a simple online reinforcement learning to a large scale adaptive language modelling."
"The advent open-source software question answering websites contributed improving way developers produce code. Nowadays, code search permeates development activities. Developers spend 15\% time searching online piece code works, fix bug, use API . According \citet{sadowski-how-developers-search-for-code-case-study:2015}, Google, developers search code 12 times day, clicking 2 3 results average per search session. Most developers use general-purpose search engines look code , uses page rank indexes tactics optimized searching code. Then, general-purpose search engines adequately find code snippets unless accompanying descriptions. According \citet{masudur-developers-use-google-code-retrieval:2018}, developers spend time, visit pages, change queries often code-related searches. In particular, newcomers project greatly benefit semantic search since face variety entrance barriers . GitHub, popular source code hosting platform, attempted build semantic code search. They extracted millions lines code repositories matched code snippet docstring. The final results satisfactory tool could find relevant code snippet user provided query matched docstring description . According \citet{cambronero-deep-code-search-2019}, users' intents better matched questions collected question-answering sites related programming, e.g., Stack Overflow. Those sites allow users ask question approve best answer it. Other users vote helpful answer mark wrong helpful ones. Those collective actions curate organize information. Initial code search studies based deductive-logic rules manually extracted features . The recent success artificial neural networks shifted recent works machine learning-based approach. \citet{cambronero-deep-code-search-2019} coined name, neural code search, i.e., code search based neural networks. Recent works applied neural networks summarize retrieve code snippets. \citet{cambronero-deep-code-search-2019} proposed neural network attention mechanism \citet{Gu-deep-code-search:2018} presented recurrent neural network. Our novel approach based Convolutional Neural Networks . For best knowledge, CNNs yet used search code, achieved good results selecting answers . CNNs prioritize local interactions translation invariant, important traits task. In study, answer following research questions: The universal learning algorithm aware humans learn. Human learning robust flexible -- relies causality, ability fast sequential adaptation balances memory encoding active forgetting, across large number familiar unfamiliar scenarios. Meta-learning offers promising computational paradigm learn universal learning algorithm data-driven way. In work, proposed meta-learning approach learn sequential adaptation algorithm arbitrary deep neural network architectures. Our approach performs sequential adaptation bounded compute memory across changing environment tasks. The proposed Online Cifar setup serve useful benchmark studying flexible models algorithms go beyond fixed distribution regime. In current state Sparse-MetaNet method, sparsity mask sampled fixed distribution. A future work explore learning-based approaches conditional mask distribution, Sparse-MetaNet model selectively encode fast-weight memory past gradients. The current work limited focus catastrophic interference issue neural networks. A future work extend Sparse-MetaNet approach mitigating issue."," Software developers routinely search for code using general-purpose search engines. However, these search engines cannot find code semantically unless it has an accompanying description. We propose a technique for semantic code search: A Convolutional Neural Network approach to code retrieval . Our technique aims to find the code snippet that most closely matches the developer's intent, expressed in natural language. We evaluated our approach's efficacy on a dataset composed of questions and code snippets collected from Stack Overflow. Our preliminary results showed that our technique, which prioritizes local interactions , improved the state-of-the-art  by 5\% on average, retrieving the most relevant code snippets in the top 3  positions by almost 80\% of the time. Therefore, our technique is promising and can improve the efficacy of semantic code retrieval."
"In recent years, deep learning methods become standard solving information retrieval tasks. These methods effectively map words phrases vector representations. These representations facilitate better matching phrases similar meanings. Phrases closer meaning represented closer vector space. In information retrieval, many ways develop relevance scores used, counting word overlap query document. Recently, complex machine learning models use human-verified datasets train models assign similarity scores used rankings. Applying deep learning Natural Language Processing problems given rise new approaches better represent sentence閳ユ獨 meaning using neural networks. For instance, Long Short Term Memory models attention mechanism allow word relationships constructed different sentences thus words better placed context, rather examining words closest them. A breakthrough development Natural Language Processing, BERT architecture, extracts word consequently sentence representations masking words throughout sentence predicting omitted words, using self-attention encode entire sentence once. Within BERT framework, model also trained predict next sentence choices, given input sentence. \\ Even advances, deep learning methods still struggle inherent difficulties IR tasks. These challenges result discrepancies query document vocabulary, limited size data used training, weaknesses given human-generated query. In effort mitigate effects, team閳ユ獨 approach inspired existing method, doc2query, given input document uses transformer model architecture predict plausible queries leading document. Although shown expanded documents indeed allowed improved retrieval performance downstream ranking model, approach requires documents collection interest first ``pre-indexed'' feeding input transformer model, practical. Instead, propose query2query method takes given query input generates several queries similar meaning. The hope create powerful query augmenting generated queries given query single representation, used match desired passage. To complete architecture, feed expanded queries pre-trained BERT model predict similarity scores queries documents produce final ranking. The goal approach reduce surface form 閳ユ笜oise閳 within certain query generating queries ask information, different ways. By different representations 閳ユ笩ame閳 query, hope create holistic queries result obtain end-to-end method generalize better potentially reduce problems modern IR faces. Our model, CoNCRA, achieved MRR score 5\ higher average Unif, state-of-the-art technique. We could rank relevant code snippet among first 3 positions 78\ cases. Our technique achieved TOP-1 accuracy 60\ , techniques achieved 50\ . The results seem promising, plan investigation check model invariant datasets. We also investigate transfer learning, e.g., checking model trained Stack Overflow dataset find relevant code snippets GitHub corpus . Our approach based NLP technique proposed \citet{feng-2015}, future work may use transformers autoencoders, techniques showed good results many NLP tasks."," This paper describes Brown University's submission to the TREC 2019 Deep Learning track. We followed a 2-phase method for producing a ranking of passages for a given input query: In the the first phase, the user's query is expanded by appending 3 queries generated by a transformer model which was trained to rephrase an input query into semantically similar queries. The expanded query can exhibit greater similarity in surface form and vocabulary overlap with the passages of interest and can therefore serve as enriched input to any downstream information retrieval method. In the second phase, we use a BERT-based model pre-trained for language modeling but fine-tuned for query - document relevance prediction to compute relevance scores for a set of 1000 candidate passages per query and subsequently obtain a ranking of passages by sorting them based on the predicted relevance scores.  According to the results published in the official Overview of the TREC Deep Learning Track 2019, our team ranked 3rd in the passage retrieval task , and 2nd when considering only re-ranking submissions."

Since the given training dataset only comprised of 108 conversations, leveraging pre-trained models is effective than fitting from scratch. Therefore, this paper aims to recognize Alzheimer闁炽儲鐛 Dementia by exploiting various multi-modal features from pre-trained networks. With the given dataset of conversational form, we modify a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network based structure to compute input modalities. Our model performs classification and regression tasks simultaneously and is capable of computing conversations with variable lengths. For the classification task, the best test accuracy using only acoustic input is 72.92\%, while using both modality results in 81.25\%. For the regression task, we achieved an RMSE score of 3.7749 . Additionally, our 5-fold cross-validation result for the regression task shows the possibility of classifying 4 classes of cognitive impairment, categorized by the MMSE score, with an accuracy of 78.70\%.   %We use 5-fold cross-validation for measuring model performance. For the classification task, the best F1 score using only acoustic input is 86.28\%, while using both modality results in 94.54\%. For the regression task, the best RMSE score is 3.3493.   Collecting and accessing a large amount of medical data is very time-consuming and laborious, not only because it is difficult to find specific patients but also because it is required to resolve the confidentiality of a patient's medical records. On the other hand, there are deep learning models, trained on easily collectible, large scale datasets such as Youtube or Wikipedia, offering useful representations. It could therefore be very advantageous to utilize the features from these pre-trained networks for handling a small amount of data at hand. In this work, we exploit various multi-modal features extracted from pre-trained networks to recognize Alzheimer's Dementia using a neural network, with a small dataset provided by the ADReSS Challenge at INTERSPEECH 2020.

"Transformer one state-of-the-art approaches Neural Machine Translation , hence, widely accepted. For example, WMT19 machine translation tasks, reported 80\% submitted systems adopted Transformer architecture . Note high translation quality Transformer models entails large number parameters. Moreover, Transformer model inherently much slower conventional machine translation approaches mainly due auto-regressive inference scheme incrementally generating token. As result, deploying Transformer model mobile devices limited resources involves numerous practical implementation issues. To address implementation challenges little degradation translation quality, study low-bit quantization strategy Transformer accomplish high-performance on-device NMT. We note previous studies compress Transformer models utilize uniform quantization . While uniform quantization may effective memory footprint savings, would face various issues improve inference time maintain reasonable BLEU score. For example, even integer arithmetic units inference operations present limited speed resulting BLEU score quantized Transformer substantially degraded low-bit quantization INT4 . While determining number quantization bits Transformer, crucial consider component Transformer may exhibit varied sensitivity quantization error toward degradation translation quality . Accordingly, mixed precision quantization suggested effort assign different numbers quantization bits depending component quantization sensitive loss function. In addition, illustrate later, even assigning different quantization bits row embedding block reduce overall number quantization bits entire Transformer model. Our proposed quantization strategy, thus, provides finer-grained mixed precision approach compared previous methods, consider layer-wise matrix-wise mixed precision. % One important aspect block Transformer contributes inference computation translation accuracy differently. Transformer consists three major blocks: embedding, encoder, decoder. The embedding block huge number parameters due dependence vocabulary size, easily scale tens thousands. On contrary, matrices encoder decoder relatively small since independent vocabulary size. As result, embedding block causes major memory latency consumption. Since decoding steps parallelizable inference time, also contributes largely inference computation. % In consideration these, propose mixed precision quantization strategy Transformer quantization efficient inference computation reasonable accuracy loss. Accommodating distinguished implementation properties component Transformer, propose following methodologies decide precision block: 1) case embedding block, statistical importance word taken account 2) encoder decoder blocks, sensitivity quantized sub-layer considered. The main contributions paper follows: For classification task, best test accuracy using acoustic input 72.92\ , using modality results 81.25\ . For regression task, achieved RMSE score 3.7749 . Additionally, 5-fold cross-validation result regression task shows possibility classifying 4 classes cognitive impairment, categorized MMSE score, accuracy 78.70\ . This paper demonstrates extracted features pre-trained networks satisfactory handling small amounts data, recognize Alzheimer's Dementia. The proposed model compute variable lengths dialogue also introduce productive methods fit network little amount data. Furthermore, model require metadata also perform well without transcript, may practical real-world situations.

Acknowledgements","  The deployment of widely used Transformer architecture is challenging because of heavy computation load and memory overhead during inference, especially when the target device is limited in computational resources such as mobile or edge devices. Quantization is an effective technique to address such challenges. Our analysis shows that for a given number of quantization bits, each block of Transformer contributes to translation quality and inference computations in different manners. Moreover, even inside an embedding block, each word presents vastly different contributions. Correspondingly, we propose a mixed precision quantization strategy to represent Transformer weights by an extremely low number of bits . For example, for each word in an embedding block, we assign different quantization bits based on statistical property. Our quantized Transformer model achieves 11.8$\times$ smaller model size than the baseline model, with less than -0.5 BLEU. We achieve 8.3$\times$ reduction in run-time memory footprints and 3.5$\times$ speed up  such that our proposed compression strategy enables efficient implementation for on-device NMT."

While state-of-the-art approaches bidirectional image-sentence retrieval leveraged visual-semantic consistency great success standard datasets MSCOCO Flickr30K , show Appendix able reason effectively objects image named entities present caption article body. This due discrepancies distribution datasets, captions standard datasets usually contain general terms including woman dog opposed named entities Mrs Betram Golden Retriever, commonly contained news article captions. Moreover, images often directly related articles associated with. For example, Figure , article contains mentions British Prime Minister. Yet, contains image United Kingdom flag. To circumvent problem, present DIDAN, simple yet surprisingly effective approach exploits possible semantic inconsistencies text image/captions detect machine-generated articles. For example, notice article caption Fig. actually mention different Prime Ministers. Besides evaluating semantic relevance images captions article, DIDAN also exploits co-occurrences named entities article captions determine authenticity score. The authenticity score thought probability article human-generated. We adopt learning paradigm commonly used image-sentence retrieval models trained reason dissimilarities images non-matching captions. In instance, negative samples constitute articles non-corresponding image-caption pairs. Not reasonable approach adversarial generative model unknown, show empirically crucial detecting machine-generated articles high confidence even access machine-generated samples training. More importantly, means DIDAN easily trained abundance online news articles without additional costly annotations. To study threat, construct NeuralNews dataset contains human machine-generated articles. These articles contain title, main body well images captions. The human-generated articles sourced GoodNews dataset. Using titles main article bodies context, use GROVER generate articles.

We also achieve compression ratio 8.3 memory footprints 3.5 speed mobile device . \clearpage"," Large-scale dissemination of disinformation online intended to mislead or deceive the general population is a major societal problem. Rapid progression in image, video, and natural language generative models has only exacerbated this situation and intensified our need for an effective defense mechanism. While existing approaches have been proposed to defend against neural fake news, they are generally constrained to the very limited setting where articles only have text and metadata such as the title and authors. In this paper, we introduce the more realistic and challenging task of defending against machine-generated news that also includes images and captions. To identify the possible weaknesses that adversaries can exploit, we create a NeuralNews dataset composed of 4 different types of generated articles as well as conduct a series of human user study experiments based on this dataset. In addition to the valuable insights gleaned from our user study experiments, we provide a relatively effective approach based on detecting visual-semantic inconsistencies, which will serve as an effective first line of defense and a useful reference for future work in defending against machine-generated disinformation."

"As key step constructing knowledge graph, relation extraction task extract relation entities expressed sentence. Previous work largely focused intra-sentence binary relation extraction, goal extract relation entity pair sentence. However, relations require two entities may span multiple sentences, defined n-ary cross-sentence relation extraction. As example shown Table, relation ``educate'' includes four entities, person's ""name``, ""academic degree``, ""academic major`` ""school``. In addition, relation spans four sentences example. Some prior works applied supervised learning approach tackle task, require large-scale labeled training data. \end{table} To obtain large-scale annotated data, work assumes consecutive sentences contain entities relation knowledge base, sentences whole describe relation. This assumption referred distant supervision n-ary cross-sentence relation extraction task. Even though methods based distant supervision quickly annotate sentences, still two main limitations: 1) suffer noisy labeling problem; 2) strong distant supervision assumption consider non-consecutive sentences, reduces generalizability trained model. As example shown Table, sentences 18th 20th positions describe fact labeled using distant supervision consecutive. The first sentence incorrectly labeled noisy labeled data, describes Alan Turing's work instead education. To address first limitation, propose train sentence distribution estimator , two-level agent reinforcement learning model. This provides well-trained model select high-quality labeled sentence groups alleviate impact noisy data. There previous works applying reinforcement learning remove binary intra-sentence noisy data achieve state-of-the-art performance. When applying RL n-ary cross-sentence relation extraction, key challenge RL model learn sentence features, also know context relation sentence. In paper, process selecting sentences influenced feature sentence itself, also indicators defined , measure semantic relationship sentences. Moreover, whether sentence selected state going affect decision next state. This state transition property provides ability choose best combination sentences sentence group.

However, on one hand, this assumption introduces noisy labeled data and harms the models' performance. On the other hand, some non-consecutive sentences also describe one relation and these sentences cannot be labeled under this assumption. In this paper, we relax this strong assumption by a weaker distant supervision assumption to address the second issue and propose a novel sentence distribution estimator model to address the first problem. This estimator selects correctly labeled sentences to alleviate the effect of noisy data is a two-level agent reinforcement learning model. In addition, a novel universal relation extractor with a hybrid approach of attention mechanism and PCNN is proposed such that it can be deployed in any tasks, including consecutive and non-consecutive sentences. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model can reduce the impact of noisy data and achieve better performance on general n-ary cross sentence relation extraction task compared to baseline models."
"Healthcare information systems store huge volumes electronic health records contain detailed visit information patients period time. The data structured three levels top bottom: patient journey, individual visit medical code. Fig. provides typical example structure. An anonymous patient visits his/her doctor, pathology lab admitted hospital different days. The procedures diagnoses performed visits recorded industry-standard medical codes. Each medical code, i.e. International Classification Diseases Current Procedure Terminology , lowest level, records independent observation set codes higher level depict medical conditions patient given time point. At top level, occurrences medical events different time-stamps chained together patient journey, offers informative details. Predicting sequential medical outcomes based patient's journey, hospital re-admissions diagnoses, core research task significantly benefits healthcare management hospitals governments. For example, re-admission statistics could used measure quality care; Diagnoses used understand fully patient's problems relevant medical research. However, researchers encountered many challenges attempts represent patient journeys predict medical outcomes EHR data characteristics temporality, high-dimensionality irregularity. Recurrent neural networks widely used analyze sequential data, unsurprisingly including medical events modelling clinical prediction. For example, Choi et al. proposed multi-level representation learning, integrates visits medical concepts based visit sequences co-occurrence medical concepts. They indirectly exploited RNN embed visit sequences patient representation downstream prediction tasks. Some research works directly employed RNNs model time-ordered patient visits predicting diagnoses. However, length patient visit sequence grows, RNN-based models restricted less expressive power RNNs, vanishing gradient forgetfulness. However, RNN-based models constrained forgetfulness, i.e., predictive power drops significantly sequence patient visits grows long. To memorize historical records, LSTM GRU developed utilize memory gate mechanism mitigating issues. To go further, Song et al. proposed utilise attention mechanism deep framework model sequential medical events. It worth noting sequences medical events often found lengthy, especially patient suffers chronic disease. Hence, due restricted ability RNNs long-term dependency modeling , traditional RNNs, even memory cells gates, usually underperform cases long sequence medical events. In light this, neural model overcome performance bottleneck RNN-based models particularly desirable medical predictions based longitudinal EHR data. %%%%%%%% WHAT THE RELATION BETWEEN SHEN2018DISAN AND THIS ONE?? Directional self-attention networks alleviate long sequence problems improve accuracy predictions, models trained available input information - past future.. CAN WE COME TO THE CONCLUSION: ONE OF CONTRIBUTION IS WE HAVE FULLY CONSIDERED ALL MEDICAL EVENTS COMPARING TO OTHER WORKS THAT CAN ONLY PARTIALLY CONSIDER. % Recently, attention mechanism integrated RNNs model sequential EHRs data, achieves good prediction accuracy. Although attention-based RNNs relatively improves prediction performance, limitations RNNs weaken advantage attention mechanism. In natural language processing , sole attention mechanism used construct sequence sequence model achieves state-of-the-art quality score neural machine translation task. The attention mechanism flexibility sequence length RNN, task/data-driven modeling dependencies. Unlike sequential models, computation easily significantly accelerated existing distributed/parallel computing schemes. However, best knowledge, neural net entirely based attention designed patient journey EHRs data. Most recently, attention mechanisms sprung fore effective integrations RNNs modeling sequential EHR data. So far, approaches shown satisfactory prediction accuracy, argue power attention RNN limited weaknesses RNN . In particular, Vaswani et al. used sole attention mechanism, i.e., multi-head attention self-attention, construct sequence-to-sequence model neural machine translation tasks achieved state-of-the-art quality score. And according Shen et al., self-attention mechanism allows flexibility sequence lengths RNNs task/data-driven modeling contextual dependencies. Unlike recurrent models, attention procedure easy compute computation also significantly accelerated distributed/parallel computing schemes. For example, Song et al. proposed employ 1D CNN model local context use attention mechanism capture long-term dependency sequential medical events. However, applied EHR data instead regular sequential data , current attention models cannot appropriately deal aspects EHR data, arbitrary time-stamps hierarchical data format. Hence, best knowledge, neural network-based entirely attention never designed analytics EHR data.

It uses self-attention capture contextual information temporal dependencies patient's visits. Then, propose end-to-end neural network, called Bidirectional temporal encoder Network , predict medical outcomes leveraging learned representation patient journey, representation generated solely proposed attention mechanism, MasEnc. BiteNet constructs multi-level self-attention network represent visits patient journeys simultaneously, using attention pooling stacked MasEnc layers. It worth noting that, compared existed RNN-based methods, BiteNet yield better prediction performance long sequences medical records.

A patient's EHR data is organized as a three-level hierarchy from top to bottom: patient journey - all the experiences of diagnoses and treatments over a period of time; individual visit - a set of medical codes in a particular visit; and medical code - a specific record in the form of medical codes. As EHRs begin to amass in millions, the potential benefits, which these data might hold for medical research and medical outcome prediction, are staggering - including, for example, predicting future admissions to hospitals, diagnosing illnesses or determining the efficacy of medical treatments. Each of these analytics tasks requires a domain knowledge extraction method to transform the hierarchical patient journey into a vector representation for further prediction procedure. The representations should embed a sequence of visits and a set of medical codes with a specific timestamp, which are crucial to any downstream prediction tasks. Hence, expressively powerful representations are appealing to boost learning performance. To this end, we propose a novel self-attention mechanism that captures the contextual dependency and temporal relationships within a patient's healthcare journey. An end-to-end bidirectional temporal encoder network  then learns representations of the patient's journeys, based solely on the proposed attention mechanism. We have evaluated the effectiveness of our methods on two supervised prediction and two unsupervised clustering tasks with a real-world EHR dataset. The empirical results demonstrate the proposed BiteNet model produces higher-quality representations than state-of-the-art baseline methods."

We investigate their systematic generalization abilities on a logical reasoning task in natural language, which involves reasoning over relationships between entities grounded in first-order logical proofs. Specifically, we perform soft theorem-proving by leveraging TLMs to generate natural language proofs. We test the generated proofs for logical consistency, along with the accuracy of the final inference. We observe length-generalization issues when evaluated on longer-than-trained sequences. However, we observe TLMs improve their generalization performance after being exposed to longer, exhaustive proofs. In addition, we discover that TLMs are able to generalize better using backward-chaining proofs compared to their forward-chaining counterparts, while they find it easier to generate forward chaining proofs. We observe that models that are not trained to generate proofs are better at generalizing to problems based on longer proofs. This suggests that Transformers have efficient internal reasoning strategies that are harder to interpret. These results highlight the systematic generalization behavior of TLMs in the context of logical reasoning, and we believe this work motivates deeper inspection of their underlying reasoning strategies."

We hope work inspire research systematic generalization capacity language models motivate study creation neural models greater reasoning capacity. rather greater number parameters training data. shed light symbolic reasoning capacity Transformers inspire future research directions"," High-fidelity singing voices usually require higher sampling rate  with large range of frequency to convey expression and emotion. However, higher sampling rate causes the wider frequency band and longer waveform sequences and throws challenges for singing modeling in both frequency and time domains in singing voice synthesis . Conventional SVS systems that adopt moderate sampling rate  cannot well address the above challenges. In this paper, we develop HiFiSinger, an SVS system towards high-fidelity singing voice using 48kHz sampling rate. HiFiSinger consists of a FastSpeech based neural acoustic model and a Parallel WaveGAN based neural vocoder to ensure fast training and inference and also high voice quality. To tackle the difficulty of singing modeling caused by high sampling rate , we introduce multi-scale adversarial training in both the acoustic model and vocoder to improve singing modeling. Specifically, 1) To handle the larger range of frequencies caused by higher sampling rate , we propose a novel sub-frequency GAN  on mel-spectrogram generation, which splits the full 80-dimensional mel-frequency into multiple sub-bands  and models each sub-band with a separate discriminator. 2) To model longer waveform sequences caused by higher sampling rate, we propose a multi-length GAN  for waveform generation to model different lengths of waveform sequences with separate discriminators. 3) We also introduce several additional designs and findings in HiFiSinger that are crucial for high-fidelity voices, such as adding F0  and V/UV  as acoustic features, choosing an appropriate window/hop size for mel-spectrogram, and increasing the receptive field in vocoder for long vowel modeling in singing voices. Experiment results show that HiFiSinger synthesizes high-fidelity singing voices with much higher quality: 0.32/0.44 MOS gain over 48kHz/24kHz baseline and 0.83 MOS gain over previous SVS systems.

Many techniques developed employed extracting representations speech related tasks speaker recognition speech emotion recognition using deep learning. A significant number deep learning models based Convolutional Neural Networks SR SER . The common approach training CNN models speech-related tasks use time-frequency inputs spectrograms derived raw audio signals. Given sufficient data, deep learning models enable extraction better speech representations compared methods i-Vectors . Attention mechanisms shown positive impact extracting effective deep representations input data, instance speech signals. Considerable improvements accuracy emotion recognition models speaker recognition models examples demonstrate potential benefits using attention mechanisms representation learning. Attention models uphold memory-query paradigm, memory set information items CNN embeddings region spectral representation speech-related tasks , part utterance embedded recurrent cell recurrent neural network . The query derived hidden state model either modality different one . The majority attention models used speech-related tasks, use features extracted utterances using deep neural network information items memory, last hidden layer model query . The general purpose attention model generating deep representations speech signals focus information item individually. The information items considered attention model define granularity model focus on. The spectral representation utterance enables deep learning models consider fine-grained features frequency bins short time-frames. However, typical attention models used audio signals utilize embedding obtained CNN model memory final embedding model query. Using embeddings obtained CNNs, limits granularity attention models large regions spectral representation. On hand, improving granularity CNN embeddings utterance leads large attention models harder train prone over-fitting.

Speech representations extracted by deep learning models are being used in a wide range of tasks such as speech recognition, speaker recognition, and speech emotion recognition. Attention models play an important role in improving deep learning models. However current attention mechanisms are unable to attend to fine-grained information items. In this paper we propose the novel Fine-grained Early Frequency Attention  for speech signals. This model is capable of focusing on information items as small as frequency bins. We evaluate the proposed model on two popular tasks of speaker recognition and speech emotion recognition. Two widely used public datasets, VoxCeleb and IEMOCAP, are used for our experiments. The model is implemented on top of several prominent deep models as backbone networks to evaluate its impact on performance compared to the original networks and other related work. Our experiments show that by adding FEFA to different CNN architectures, performance is consistently improved by substantial margins, even setting a new state-of-the-art for the speaker recognition task. We also tested our model against different levels of added noise showing improvements in robustness and less sensitivity compared to the backbone networks."
"Text summarization aims produce condensed summaries covering salient non-redundant information source documents. Recent studies single-document summarization benefit advances neural sequence learning well pre-trained language models make great progress. However, multi-document summarization tasks, neural models still facing challenges often underperform classical statistical methods built upon handcrafted features. We observe two major challenges adapting advanced neural SDS methods MDS: Large search space. MDS aims producing summaries multiple source documents, exceeds capacity neural SDS models sets learning obstacles adequate representations, especially considering MDS labeled data limited. For example, 287K training samples CNN/Daily Mail SDS dataset 30 DUC 2003 MDS dataset . High redundancy. In MDS, statement even sentence spread across different documents. Although SDS models adopt attention mechanisms implicit measures reduce redundancy, fail handle much higher redundancy MDS effectively . There attempts solve aforementioned challenges MDS. Regarding large search space, prior studies perform sentence filtering using sentence ranker take top-ranked sentences. However, hard cutoff search space makes approaches insufficient exploration labeled data limited ranker since sentences discarded,\footnote{ set 7 in~\citet{lebanoff-etal-2018-adapting} 15 in~\citet{zhang-etal-2018-adapting}. One document set DUC 2004, example, averages 265.4 sentences.} albeit discarded sentences important could favored. As result, although studies perform better directly applying base SDS models MDS, outperform state-of-the-art MDS methods. Regarding high redundancy, various redundancy measures proposed, including heuristic post-processing counting new bi-grams cosine similarity, dynamic scoring compares source sentence current summary like Maximal Marginal Relevance . Nevertheless, methods still use lexical features without semantic representation learning. One extension studies uses capsule networks improve redundancy measures. However, capsule networks pre-trained SDS fixed feature inputs classical methods without end-to-end representation learning. In paper, present deep RL framework, MMR-guided Reinforcement Learning MDS, unifies advances SDS one classical MDS approach, MMR end-to-end learning. \ours addresses MDS challenges follows: \ours overcomes large search space soft attention. Compared hard cutoff, soft attention favors top-ranked candidates sentence ranker . However, discard low-ranked ones, ranker imperfect, sentences ranked low may also contribute high-quality summary. Soft attention restrains search space allowing exploration limited labeled data, leading better representation learning. Specifically, \ours infuses entire prediction MMR neural module attending important sentences downplaying rest instead completely discarding them. \ours resolves high redundancy MDS unified way: explicit redundancy measure MMR incorporated neural representation current state, two modules coordinated RL reward optimization, encourages non-redundant summaries. We conduct extensive experiments ablation studies examine effectiveness \ours. Experimental results show \ours achieves state-of-the-art performance DUC 2004 TAC 2011 datasets . A comparison various combination mechanisms demonstrates benefits soft attention large search space MDS . In addition, ablation manual studies confirm \ours superior applying either RL MMR MDS alone, MMR guidance effective redundancy avoidance . \start{Contributions} We present RL-based MDS framework combines advances classical MDS neural SDS methods via end-to-end learning. We show proposed soft attention better hard cutoff previous methods learning adequate neural representations. Also, infusing neural representation current summary explicit MMR measures significantly reduces summary redundancy. We demonstrate \ours achieves new state-of-the-art results benchmark MDS datasets. \section{Conclusions}"," While neural sequence learning methods have made significant progress in single-document summarization , they produce unsatisfactory results on multi-document summarization . We observe two major challenges when adapting SDS advances to MDS:  MDS involves larger search space and yet more limited training data, setting obstacles for neural methods to learn adequate representations;  MDS needs to resolve higher information redundancy among the source documents, which SDS methods are less effective to handle. To close the gap, we present \ours, Maximal Margin Relevance-guided Reinforcement Learning for MDS, which unifies advanced neural SDS methods and statistical measures used in classical MDS.  \ours casts MMR guidance on fewer promising candidates, which restrains the search space and thus leads to better representation learning. Additionally, the explicit redundancy measure in MMR helps the neural representation of the summary to better capture redundancy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \ours achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark MDS datasets. In particular, we show the benefits of incorporating MMR into end-to-end learning when adapting SDS to MDS in terms of both learning effectiveness and efficiency.\footnote{Code can be found at \url{https://github.com/morningmoni/RL-MMR}.}"

However, there has been little work on interpreting them, and specifically on understanding which parts of the graphs  contribute to a prediction. In this work, we introduce a post-hoc method for interpreting the predictions of GNNs which identifies unnecessary edges. % Given a trained GNN model, we learn a simple classifier that, for every edge in every layer, predicts if that edge can be dropped. We demonstrate that such a classifier can be trained in a fully differentiable fashion, employing stochastic gates and encouraging sparsity through the expected  $L_0$ norm. We use our technique as an attribution method to analyze GNN models for two tasks -- question answering and semantic role labeling -- providing insights into the information flow in these models. We show that we can drop a large proportion of edges without deteriorating the performance of the model, while we can analyse the remaining edges for interpreting model predictions."

"Texts represent main source knowledge society. However, written various manners, thus creating barrier readers ideas intend convey. Therefore, document comprehension main challenge users overcome, understanding meaning behind troublesome words becoming familiar them. Complex Word Identification task intends identify hard-to-understand tokens, highlighting clarification assisting users grasping contents document. Motivation. Each culture includes exclusive ideas, available ones pass obstacle language. However, properly understanding language prove difficult task. By identifying complex words, users make consistent steps towards adapting culture accessing knowledge offer. As example, entries like ""mayoritariamente"" ""gobernatura"" Spanish environment create understanding problems non-native Spanish speakers, thus requiring users familiarize particular terms. Challenges. The identification task becomes increasingly difficult, proper complex word identification guaranteed. For example, use human identification techniques, language learners may consider new word complex, others might share opinion relying prior knowledge language. Therefore, universal annotation techniques required, ground truth established set words considered complex context. Proposed Approach. We consider state-of-the-art solutions, namely multilingual Transformer-based approaches, address CWI challenge. First, apply zero-shot learning approach. This performed training Recurrent Neural Networks Transformer-based models source language corpus, followed validating testing corpus target language, different source language. A second experiment consists one-shot learning approach considers training three languages , keeping one entry target language, validating testing English, German, Spanish, French, respectively. In addition, performed few-shot learning experiments validating testing language, training others, addition small number training entries target language.

"Aspect based sentiment analysis fine-grained sentiment analysis task. ABSA contains several subtasks, four aspect category detection detecting aspect categories mentioned sentences, aspect category sentiment analysis predicting sentiments detected aspect categories, aspect term extraction identifying aspect terms presenting sentences aspect term sentiment analysis classifying sentiments toward identified aspect terms. While aspect categories mentioned sentence predefined categories may occur sentence, aspect terms explicitly appear sentences. Fig. shows example. ACD detects two aspect categories food service ACSA predicts positive negative sentiments toward them. ATE identifies two aspect terms ``taste'' ``service'' ATSA classifies positive negative sentiments toward them. In paper, concentrate ACSA task. The ACD task auxiliary used find aspect category-related nodes sentence constituency parse trees ACSA task. Since sentence usually discusses one aspect categories expresses different sentiments toward them, various attention-based methods developed allocate appropriate sentiment words given aspect categories. Wang et al. first explore attention mechanism ACSA task proposed attention based LSTM . For given sentence aspect category mentioned sentence, AT-LSTM first models sentence via LSTM model, combines hidden states LSTM representation aspect category generate aspect category-specific word representations, finally applies attention mechanism word representations find aspect category-related sentiment words, used predict sentiment aspect category. The constrained attention networks handles multiple aspect categories sentence simultaneously introduces orthogonal sparse regularizations constrain attention weight allocation. The aspect-level sentiment capsules model performs ACD ACSA simultaneously, also uses attention mechanism find aspect category related sentiment words achieves state-of-the-art performances ACSA task. However, models directly use given aspect category find aspect category-related sentiment words, may cause mismatching sentiment words aspect categories unrelated sentiment word semantically meaningful given aspect category. For example Fig., ``Great'' ``bad'' used interchangeably. It hard attention-based methods distinguish word associated aspect category food service among ``good'' ``bad''. To solve problem, The HiErarchical ATtention network first finds aspect terms indicating given aspect cagegory, finds aspect category-related sentiment words depending position information semantics aspect terms. Although HEAT obtains good results, train HEAT, additionally need annotate aspect terms indicating given aspect category, time-consuming expensive. To mitigate mismatch problem, propose Sentence Constituent-Aware Network aspect-category sentiment analysis require additional annotation. SCAN contains two graph attention networks interactive loss function. Given sentence, first use Berkeley Neural Parser generate constituency parse tree. The two GATs generate representations nodes sentence constituency parse tree ACD task ACSA task, respectively. The GAT ACD mainly attends words indicating aspect categories, GAT ACSA mainly attends sentiment words. For given aspect category, interactive loss function helps ACD task find nodes predict aspect category can閳ユ獩 predict aspect categories. The sentiment words nodes used predict sentiment polarity aspect category ACSA task. Fig. shows constituency parse tree sentence ``Greate taste bad service.''. For aspect category food, SCAN first finds yellow nodes ``Greate taste'' ``taste'', predict sentiment food based sentiment word ``Great'' node ``Great taste''. SCAN excludes blue node ``Great taste bad service.'' food, predict food also service.

Since a sentence usually discusses one or more aspect categories and expresses different sentiments toward them, various attention-based methods have been developed to allocate the appropriate sentiment words for the given aspect category and obtain promising results. However, most of these methods directly use the given aspect category to find the aspect category-related sentiment words, which may cause mismatching between the sentiment words and the aspect categories when an unrelated sentiment word is semantically meaningful for the given aspect category. To mitigate this problem, we propose a Sentence Constituent-Aware Network  for aspect-category sentiment analysis. SCAN contains two graph attention modules and an interactive loss function. The graph attention modules generate representations of the nodes in sentence constituency parse trees for the aspect category detection  task and the ACSA task, respectively. ACD aims to detect aspect categories discussed in sentences and is a auxiliary task. For a given aspect category, the interactive loss function helps the ACD task to find the nodes which can predict the aspect category but can闁炽儲鐛 predict other aspect categories. The sentiment words in the nodes then are used to predict the sentiment polarity of the aspect category by the ACSA task. The experimental results on five public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SCAN. \footnote{Data and code can be found at https://github.com/l294265421/SCAN}  \keywords{Aspect Category Sentiment Analysis  \and Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis \and Graph Attention Network.}"

To ease process review writing, task personalized review generation~ proposed automatically produce review text conditioned necessary context data, \eg users, items, ratings. As mainstream solution, RNN-based models widely applied PRG task. Standard RNN models mainly model sequential dependency among tokens, cannot effectively generate high-quality review text. Many efforts devoted improving kind architecture PRG task, including context utilization, long text generation, writing style enrichment. These studies improved performance PRG task extent. However, two major issues still remain solved. First, generated text likely uninformative, lacking factual description product information. Although several studies try incorporate structural semantic features , mainly extract features review text. Using review data alone, difficult fully capture diverse comprehensive facts unstructured text. Second, studies focus word-level generation, makes difficult directly model user preference higher level. For example, given product, user may focus price, another user may emphasize look. To address issues, propose improve PRG task external knowledge graph . By associating online items KG entities, able obtain rich attribute feature information items, potentially useful PRG task.

It may suitable simply integrate KG information enhance text representations capture user preference due varying intrinsic characteristics different data signals. In order bridge semantic gap, augment original KG user word nodes, construct heterogeneous knowledge graph adding user-item links entity-word links. User-item links formed according user-item interactions, entity-word links formed according co-occurrence review sentences. We seek learn unified semantic space able encode different kinds nodes.

Second, considering users target nodes, utilize graph infer users' preference specific relation aspect . The two kinds information reflect word- aspect-level enrichment, respectively.

Most of previous studies do not explicitly model  factual description of products, tending to generate uninformative content. Moreover, they mainly focus on word-level generation, but cannot accurately reflect more abstractive  user preference in multiple aspects.  To address the above issues, we propose a novel knowledge-enhanced PRG model  based on capsule graph neural network~. We first  construct a heterogeneous knowledge graph  for utilizing rich item attributes. We adopt  Caps-GNN to learn graph capsules for encoding underlying characteristics from the HKG. Our generation process contains two major steps, namely aspect sequence generation and sentence generation. First, based on graph capsules, we adaptively learn aspect capsules for inferring the aspect sequence.   Then, conditioned on the inferred aspect label, we design a graph-based copy mechanism to generate sentences by incorporating related entities or words from HKG. To our knowledge, we are the first to utilize knowledge graph for the PRG task. The incorporated KG information is able to enhance user preference at both aspect and word levels. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our model on the PRG task."

However, the decision-making processes of these models are generally not interpretable to users. In various domains, such as healthcare, finance, or law, it is critical to know the reasons behind a decision made by an artificial intelligence system. Therefore, several directions for explaining neural models have recently been explored.   In this thesis, I investigate two major directions for explaining deep neural networks. The first direction consists of feature-based post-hoc explanatory methods, that is, methods that aim to explain an already trained and fixed model , and that provide explanations in terms of input features, such as tokens for text and superpixels for images . The second direction consists of self-explanatory neural models that generate natural language explanations, that is, models that have a built-in module that generates explanations for the predictions of the model. The contributions in these directions are as follows.   % In this thesis, I investigate the topic of explaining deep neural networks. This topic is crucial nowadays as neural model are becoming more and more employed in real-world applications due to their high performance in diverse areas, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. However, the decision-making processes learned by these models are not generally human-interpretable. In various real-world applications, such as healthcare, finance, or criminal justice, it is critical to know the reasons behind a decision made by an artificial intelligence system. Therefore, several directions for explaining neural models have recently been explored.   % a series of methods have recently been developed to provide explanations for the predictions of neural models. This thesis brings contributions to two major directions for explaining deep neural networks: feature-based post-hoc explanatory methods and self-explanatory neural models that generate natural language explanations for their predictions. The contributions are as follows.   %However, it is still an open question how to verify whether the explanations provided by these methods are faithfully describing the decision-making processes of the models that they aim to explain. Secondly, it is also an open question whether neural networks can learn from human-provided natural language explanations for the ground-truth labels at training time, as well as support their predictions with natural language explanations at test time, just like humans do.    First, I reveal certain difficulties of explaining even trivial models using only input features. I show that, despite the apparent implicit assumption that explanatory methods should look for one specific ground-truth feature-based explanation, there is often more than one such explanation for a prediction. I also show that two prevalent classes of explanatory methods target different types of ground-truth explanations without explicitly mentioning it. Moreover, I show that, sometimes, neither of these explanations is enough to provide a complete view of a decision-making process on an instance. %These findings can have an important impact on how users choose explanatory methods to best suit their needs.    Second, I introduce a framework for automatically verifying the faithfulness with which feature-based post-hoc explanatory methods describe the decision-making processes of the models that they aim to explain. This framework relies on the use of a particular type of model that is expected to provide insight into its decision-making process. I analyse potential limitations of this approach and introduce ways to alleviate them.  % The introduced verification framework is generic and can be instantiated on different tasks and domains to provide off-the-shelf sanity tests that can be used to test feature-based post-hoc explanatory methods. I instantiate this framework on a task of sentiment analysis and provide sanity tests\footnote{The sanity tests are available at \\ \url{https://github.com/OanaMariaCamburu/CanITrustTheExplainer}.} %to test any feature-based post-hoc explanatory method. Furthermore,  on which I present the performances of three popular explanatory methods. %The results show that these methods may provide unfaithful explanations.  %I also discuss ways in which the current limitations of the framework can further be addressed to lead to more robust and flexible verifications.    %In the process of developing this framework, I uncover several ways in which a particular type of model that is expected to provide insight into its decision-making process can provide misleading such insight. I also introduce checks that can be done to account for this misleading insight in order to use this type of model in the proposed framework.  % %%%%%%%% BEFORE %%%%%%%%%%The framework is generic and can be instantiated on different tasks and domains.

I call this explanation-augmented dataset e-SNLI.\footnote{The dataset is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/OanaMariaCamburu/e-SNLI}.} %, which I release publicly\footnote{The dataset is available at \url{https://github.com/OanaMariaCamburu/e-SNLI}.} %to advance research in the direction of training with and generation of natural language explanations.  % Further, I provide empirical evidence that models generating correct explanations are more reliable than models that just predict the correct labels.  % I also train different neural models that generate natural language explanations at test time, and I measure the success of these models to generate correct explanations. I also investigate whether the presence of natural language explanations at training time can lead a model to produce better universal sentence representations and to perform better on out-of-domain datasets. I do a series of experiments that investigate both the capabilities of neural models to generate correct natural language explanations at test time, and the benefits of providing natural language explanations at training time.  Fourth, I show that current self-explanatory models that generate natural language explanations for their own predictions may generate inconsistent explanations, such as ``There is a dog in the image.'' and ``There is no dog in the [same] image.''. Inconsistent explanations reveal either that the explanations are not faithfully describing the decision-making process of the model or that the model learned a flawed decision-making process.  I introduce a simple yet effective adversarial framework for sanity checking models against the generation of inconsistent natural language explanations. Moreover, as part of the framework, I address the problem of adversarial attacks with exact target sequences, a scenario that was not previously addressed in sequence-to-sequence attacks, and which can be useful for other tasks in natural language processing. I apply the framework on a state of the art neural model on e-SNLI and show that this model can generate a significant number of inconsistencies.  This work paves the way for obtaining more robust neural models accompanied by faithful explanations for their predictions.  %My hope is that in the future feature-based post-hoc explanatory methods will be superseded  by robust and accurate neural models that faithfully explain themselves to their human users in natural language."

"The desire human-like interfaces technical systems, evidenced growing use intelligent assistants, belies need conversational AI systems accomplish wide range tasks, booking restaurants, trains, flights, IT help desk accessing financial accounts transaction records. The wide range tasks necessitated need flexible scalable dialogue system support variety use cases minimal development maintenance effort. Existing dialogue systems broken two major categories, open-domain dialogue systems, focus non-task related conversations, task-oriented dialogue systems, focus user task completion. A typical open-domain system uses end-to-end neural architecture often trained input output utterances human-to-human conversations . While open-domain systems optimized engaging human-like conversation, lack inherent ability interface systems behalf conversation partner. Whereas, typical task-oriented dialogue system seeks understand human intents execute them. This done adopting modularized pipeline architecture three modules sequentially connected shown Fig. . A natural language understanding module recognizes user intents extract useful entity information . The dialogue management module contains two submodules, dialogue state tracker dialogue action policy modules. The DST module tracks mapping entities slots relevant required completing user tasks . The POL module decides actions execute via API. Finally, natural language generation module generates user response based user aspects system actions . In cases, multiple modules combined together, e.g. systems composite NLU DST module , systems composite POL NLG module maps previous utterances dialogue states system response . Despite research advances modular neural approaches, hardly used practice. Industrial dialogue systems, though modularized, still use expensive expert driven rule-based heuristics implemented several lines codes hand-crafted templates, therefore difficult scale number use cases grows. More recently, renewed effort apply single end-to-end neural architecture model task-oriented dialogue use autoregressive transformer architecture . This led reformulation dialogue system design text generation sequence modeling task. While efforts obtained state-of-the-art performance publicly available task-oriented dialogue datasets, still room improvement, especially areas generality practicality. First, problem formulation fails reconcile open-domain task-oriented dialogue model architecture. Also, many cases, address complexity action policy especially towards back-end API system. Finally, fully incorporate control, verification explanation capabilities make modularized approaches attractive. To resolve shortcomings, propose DLGNet-Task, end-to-end neural network simultaneously handles open-domain task-oriented dialogue, way model outputs controllable, verifiable, explainable module level. This system compatible data driven expert driven rule-based approaches. That is, approach simultaneously modular end-to-end, drop-in replacement traditional modular task-oriented dialogue systems. To best knowledge, expressive approach date achieving objective. In summary, able model individual behavior NLU, DM NLG components single neural network model trained end-to-end. Still, model flexible enough allow individual modules separately trained validated line traditional TOD system. % Validation module level provide information additional training needed. It could also help balancing contribution module model finetuned module-level objectives. % The DLGNet-Task model based autoregressive transformer architecture similar DLGNet GPT-2/3 models. To evaluate performance DLGNet-Task, trained model system-level training objective modified MultiWoz2.1 dataset. The dataset modification done mainly support DLGNet-Task design framework . Based widely used TOD metrics, inform rate, success rate, BLEU score , experiments show DLGNet-Task produces comparable performance state-of-the-art approaches MultiWoz2.1 dataset. % addition controllable, verifiable, explainable model's intermediate outputs. In paper, presented technique optimal synthesis multimodal specifications. On benchmark complex regex synthesis problems, showed approach substantially accurate past models, synthesis algorithm finds model-optimal program frequently compared beam search. While evaluated method context regular expressions, technique also applicable synthesis tasks."," Task oriented dialogue  requires the complex interleaving of a number of individually controllable components with strong guarantees for explainability and verifiability. This has made it difficult to adopt the multi-turn multi-domain dialogue generation capabilities of streamlined end-to-end open-domain dialogue systems. In this paper, we present a new framework, DLGNet-Task, a unified task-oriented dialogue system which employs autoregressive transformer networks such as DLGNet and GPT-2/3 to complete user tasks in multi-turn multi-domain conversations. Our framework enjoys the controllable, verifiable, and explainable outputs of modular approaches, and the low development, deployment and maintenance cost of end-to-end systems. Treating open-domain system components as additional TOD system modules allows DLGNet-Task to learn the joint distribution of the inputs and outputs of all the functional blocks of existing modular approaches such as, natural language understanding , state tracking, action policy, as well as natural language generation . Rather than training the modules individually, as is common in real-world systems, we trained them jointly  with appropriate module separations. When evaluated on the MultiWOZ2.1 dataset, DLGNet-Task shows comparable performance to the existing state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, using DLGNet-Task in conversational AI systems reduces the level of effort required for developing, deploying, and maintaining intelligent assistants at scale.  % significant improvement over existing approaches, and achieves state-of-the-art performance at both the module and system levels."
"Knowledge graphs represent knowledge world relationships entities, i.e., triples form . Such knowledge resource provides clean structured evidence many downstream applications question answering. KGs usually constructed human experts, time-consuming leads highly incomplete graphs . Therefore automatic KG completion proposed infer missing link relationship head entity tail entity . Existing KG completion work mainly makes use two types information: 1) co-occurrence entities relations 2) deducible reasoning paths tuples. KG embeddings encode entities relations, first type information, together continuous vector space low-rank tensor approximations~. Ours approach utilizes second type information, reasoning path tuples deduced target tuple~. Here reasoning path starts head entity ends tail entity \e{t}: \e{h \overset{r_1}{\rightarrow} e_1 \overset{r_k}{\rightarrow} e_k \overset{r_N}{\rightarrow} t}, \e{r_1 \wedge ... \wedge r_N} forms relation chain infers existence . Therefore methods also referred multi-hop reasoning KGs, learns multi-hop chain rule deduce target . An example chain given Figurea infer whether athlete plays location. Multi-hop reasoning approaches usually utilize richer evidence self-justifiable terms reasoning path rules used predictions, making prediction missing relations interpretable. Despite advantages success multi-hop reasoning approach , target relationship may perfectly inferred single relation chain. There could exist multiple weak relation chains correlate target relation. Figure gives examples cases. These multiple chains could leveraged following ways: reasoning process naturally relies logic conjunction multiple chains ; commonly, instances none chains accurate, aggregating multiple pieces evidence improves confidence , also observed case-based study works. Inspired observations, propose concept multi-chain multi-hop rule set. Here, instead treating single multi-hop chain rule, learn rules consisting small set multi-hop chains. Therefore inference target relationships becomes joint scoring set chains. {We treat set chains one rule and, since different query pairs follow different rules, together set rules reason relation.} Learning generalized multi-hop rule set combinatorial search problem. We address challenge game-theoretic approach inspired by. Our approach consists two steps: selecting generalized multi-hop rule set employing Multi-Layer Perceptron candidate chains; reasoning generalized rule set, uses another MLP model conditional probability target relationship given selected relation chains. The nonlinearity MLP reasoner provides potential model logic conjunction among selected chains rule set. We demonstrate advantage method KG completion tasks FB15K-237 NELL-995. Our method outperforms existing single-chain approaches, showing defined generalized rules necessary many reasoning tasks. In paper, proposed DLGNet-Task, end-to-end neural network framework modeling multi-turn multi-domain task-oriented dialogue. The DLGNet-Task model learns joint distribution nodes dialogue flow graph capable representing task-oriented open-domain dialogue systems. For TOD specific applications, DLGNet-Task also capable learning action policy towards back-end API. Experimental results show DLGNet-Task gives comparable performance existing approaches practical focus. The results also showed performance DLGNet hampered errors original MultiWoz dataset well noise introduced data processing. While DLGNet-task framework capable learning controllable, verifiable explainable end-to-end model. This also shows need consistent TOD datasets properly defined dialogue flow graph. We hope explore direction part future work terms dataset generation data processing pipeline. We also hope improve DLGNet-Task model performance adversarial reinforcement learning. \clearpage \break \iffalse \iftrue \setcounter{table}{0} \renewcommand{\thetable}{A\arabic{table}}"," Multi-hop reasoning approaches over knowledge graphs infer a missing relationship between entities with a multi-hop rule, which corresponds to a chain of relationships. We extend existing works to consider a generalized form of multi-hop rules, where each rule is a set of relation chains.  To learn such generalized rules efficiently, we propose a two-step approach that first selects a small set of relation chains as a rule and then evaluates the confidence of the target relationship by jointly scoring the selected chains. A game-theoretical framework is proposed to this end to simultaneously optimize the rule selection and prediction steps. Empirical results show that our multi-chain multi-hop  rules result in superior results compared to the standard single-chain approaches, justifying both our formulation  of  generalized rules  and the effectiveness of the proposed learning framework."
"Generating text conforms syntactic semantic constraints benefits many NLP applications. To name few, paired data limited, \citet{yang-etal-2019-low} build templates large-scale unpaired data aid training dialog generation model; \citet{Niu2017ASO} \citet{liu-etal-2019-rhetorically} apply style constraints adjust formality rhetoric utterances; \citet{iyyer2018adversarial} \citet{li-etal-2019-Insufficient} augment dataset using controlled generation improve model performance. We study problem syntactically controlled text generation, aims generate target text pre-defined syntactic guidance. Most recent studies topic use sentences exemplars specify syntactic guidance. However, guidance specified sentence vague, syntactic semantic factors tangled. Different them, use constituency parse trees explicit syntactic constraints. As providing full-fledged parse trees target text impractical, require template parse tree sketches top levels full tree . Figure shows pipeline. \citet{iyyer2018adversarial} adopt setting ours. Their proposed SCPN model uses two LSTM encoders respectively encode source text parse tree, connects one decoder additional attention pointer structures. Nonetheless, recurrent encoders suffer information loss compressing whole sequence one vector also incapable properly modeling tree structure constituency parse well. Consequently, network tends ``translate'' parse tree, instead learning real syntactic structures it. % \zc{this sentence still unclear.} We propose Transformer-based syntax-guided text generation method, named \ours. It first expands template constituency parse tree full-fledged parse tree tailored input source text, uses full tree guide text generation. To capture tree structure syntax, apply path attention mechanism text generation model. It forces one node attend nodes located path instead nodes tree. Such mechanism limits information flow among nodes constituency tree direct ancestor-descendant relationship, forcing parent nodes carry information children. In cooperation path attention, linearize constituency trees compact node-level format . Moreover, address challenge properly integrating semantic syntactic information, design multi-encoder attention mechanism . It enables Transformer decoder accept outputs multiple encoders simultaneously. We evaluated model controlled paraphrasing task. The experiment results show \ours outperforms state-of-the-art SCPN method syntactic quality semantic quality. % \zc{ use absolute improvements instead relative ones} Human evaluations prove method generates semantically syntactically superior sentences, semantic syntactic score improvements. % \zc{also give concrete numbers here, much improvements?} Further, find multi-encoder attention mechanism enhances Transformer's ability deal multiple inputs, path attention mechanism significantly contributes model's semantic performance . Our contributions include: 1) multi-encoder attention mechanism allows Transformer decoder attend multiple encoders; 2) path attention mechanism designed better incorporate tree-structured syntax guidance special tree linearization format; 3) syntax-guided text generation method \ours achieves new state-of-the-art semantic syntactic performance. We propose new approach multi-chain multi-hop rule learning knowledge graph completion tasks. First, formalize concept multi-hop rule sets multiple relation chains knowledge graphs. Second, propose game-theoretical learning approach efficiently select predictive relation chains query relation. Our formulation learning method demonstrate advantages two benchmark datasets existing single-chain based approaches. For future work, plan investigate rules beyond chains, well integrate KG embeddings framework.","   We study the problem of using  constituency parse trees as syntactic guidance for controlled text generation. Existing approaches to this problem use recurrent structures, which not only suffer from the long-term dependency problem but also falls short in modeling the tree structure of the syntactic guidance. We propose to leverage the parallelism of Transformer to better incorporate parse trees. Our method first expands a partial template constituency parse tree to a full-fledged parse tree tailored for the input source text, and then uses the expanded tree to guide text generation. The effectiveness of our model in this process hinges upon two new attention mechanisms: 1) a path attention mechanism that forces one node to attend to only other nodes located in its path in the syntax tree to better incorporate syntax guidance; 2) a multi-encoder attention mechanism that allows the decoder to dynamically attend to information from multiple encoders. Our experiments in the controlled paraphrasing task show that our method outperforms SOTA models both semantically and syntactically, improving the best baseline's BLEU score from $11.83$ to $26.27$."
"Recently, great success automatic text summarization generation. To better compare improve performance models, evaluation systems problem interest.

In this work, we propose to evaluate the summary qualities without reference summaries by unsupervised contrastive learning. Specifically, we design a new metric which covers both linguistic qualities and semantic informativeness based on BERT. To learn the metric, for each summary, we construct different types of negative samples with respect to different aspects of the summary qualities, and train our model with a ranking loss. Experiments on Newsroom and CNN/Daily Mail demonstrate that our new evaluation method outperforms other metrics even without reference summaries. Furthermore, we show that our method is general and transferable across datasets."

"Conversational Machine Reading challenging rule text may contain literal answer, provide procedure derive interactions . In case, machine needs read rule text, interpret user scenario, clarify unknown user's background asking questions, derive final answer. Taking Figure example, answer user whether suitable loan program, machine needs interpret rule text know requirements, understand meets ``American small business'' user scenario, ask follow-up clarification questions ``for-profit business'' ``not get financing resources'', finally concludes answer ``Yes'' user's initial question. Existing approaches decompose problem two sub-tasks. Given rule text, user question, user scenario, dialog history , first sub-task make decision among ``Yes'', ``No'', ``Inquire'' ``Irrelevant''. The ``Yes/No'' directly answers user question ``Irrelevant'' means user question unanswerable rule text.

We use a wide set of probing tasks, each of which corresponds to a distinct sentence-level feature extracted from different levels of linguistic annotation. We show that BERT is able to encode a wide range of linguistic characteristics, but it tends to lose this information when trained on specific downstream tasks. We also find that BERT's capacity to encode different kind of linguistic properties has a positive influence on its predictions: the more it stores readable linguistic information of a sentence, the higher will be its capacity of predicting the expected label assigned to that sentence."
"Recent emergent-communication studies, renewed astonishing success neural networks, often motivated desire develop neural network agents eventually able verbally interact humans .

Encouraging might hence lead emergent languages also likely develop desirable properties. Despite importance property, \citet{chaabouni:etal:2019} showed standard neural network agents, trained play simple signaling game , develop inefficient code, even displays anti-ZLA pattern.

In work, aim understanding constraints need introduced neural network agents order overcome innate preferences communicate efficiently, showing proper ZLA pattern. To end, %follow \citet{chaabouni:etal:2019} use reconstruction game two neural network agents: speaker listener. For input, speaker outputs sequence symbols sent listener. The latter needs predict speaker's input based given message. Also, similarly previous work, inputs drawn power-law distribution. We first describe experimental optimization framework . In particular, introduce new communication system called `LazImpa', comprising two different constraints Laziness speaker side Impatience listener side. The former constraint inspired least-effort principle attested ubiquitous pressure human communication . However, constraint applied early, system learn efficient system. We show incrementally penalizing long messages cost function enables early exploration message space prevents converging inefficient local minimum. The constraint, listener side, relies prediction mechanism, argued important language comprehension \citep[e.g.,][]{federmeier2007, altmann2009}, achieved allowing listener reconstruct intended input soon possible. We also provide two-level analytical method: first, metrics quantifying efficiency code; second, new protocol measure informativeness . Applying metrics, demonstrate that, contrary standard speaker/listener agents, new communication system `LazImpa' leads emergence efficient code. The latter follows ZLA-like distribution, close natural languages . Besides plausibility introduced constraints, new communication system is, first, task- architecture-agnostic , second allows stable optimization speaker/listener. We also show listener speaker constraints fundamental emergence ZLA-like distribution, efficient natural language .

This is illustrated by the fact that in a referential game involving a speaker and a listener neural networks optimizing accurate transmission over a discrete channel, the emergent messages fail to achieve an optimal length. Furthermore, frequent messages tend to be longer than infrequent ones, a pattern contrary to the Zipf Law of Abbreviation  observed in all natural languages. Here, we show that near-optimal and ZLA-compatible messages can emerge, but only if both the speaker and the listener are modified. We hence introduce a new communication system, ``LazImpa'', where the speaker is made increasingly lazy, i.e.,~avoids long messages, and the listener impatient, i.e.,~seeks to guess the intended content as soon as possible."

Nonetheless, they exhibit a hierarchical structure. Hyperbolic spaces offer a mathematically appealing approach for learning hierarchical representations of symbolic data. However, it is not clear how to integrate hyperbolic components into downstream tasks. This is the first work that proposes a fully hyperbolic model for multi-class multi-label classification, which performs all operations in hyperbolic space. We evaluate the proposed model on two challenging datasets and compare to different baselines that operate under Euclidean assumptions.  Our hyperbolic model infers the latent hierarchy from the class distribution, captures implicit hyponymic relations in the inventory, and shows performance on par with state-of-the-art methods on fine-grained classification with remarkable reduction of the parameter size. A thorough analysis sheds light on the impact of each component in the final prediction and showcases its ease of integration with Euclidean layers. \footnote{Code available at:\\ \url{https://github.com/nlpAThits/hyfi}}"

We introduce a teacher-student imitation learning methodology and a means of converting a reinforcement learning model into a natural language understanding model. Together, these methodologies enable the introduction of contextualized language models into the sequential decision making problem space.

"% Reinforcement learning shown great success environments large state spaces. Using neural networks capture state representations allowed end-to-end training agents domains like Atari Go .

We expect apply approach various challenging real-world sequential decision scenarios, goal-directed dialogue active information-gathering."," While reinforcement learning  has been successful in natural language processing  domains such as dialogue generation and text-based games, it typically faces the problem of sparse rewards that leads to slow or no convergence. Traditional methods that use text descriptions to extract only a state representation ignore the feedback inherently present in them. In text-based games, for example, descriptions like ``Good Job! You ate the food'' indicate progress, and descriptions like ``You entered a new room'' indicate exploration. Positive and negative cues like these can be converted to rewards through sentiment analysis. This technique converts the sparse reward problem into a dense one, which is easier to solve. Furthermore, this can enable reinforcement learning without rewards, in which the agent learns entirely from these intrinsic sentiment rewards. This framework is similar to intrinsic motivation, where the environment does not necessarily provide the rewards, but the agent analyzes and realizes them by itself. We find that providing dense rewards in text-based games using sentiment analysis improves performance under some conditions."
"Natural language data rich structure, structure visible surface. Machine learning models tackling high-level language tasks would benefit uncovering underlying structures trees, sequence tags, segmentations. Traditionally, practitioners turn pipeline approaches external, pretrained model used predict, \eg, syntactic structure. The benefit approach predicted tree readily available inspection, downside errors easily propagate throughout pipeline require attention . In contrast, deep neural architectures tend eschew preprocessing, instead learn soft hidden representations, easily amenable visualization analysis. The best worlds would model structure latent variable, combining transparency pipeline approach end-to-end unsupervised representation learning makes deep models appealing. Moreover, large-capacity model tend rediscover structure scratch , structured latent variables may reduce required capacity. Learning discrete, combinatorial latent variables is, however, challenging, due intersection large cardinality null gradient issues. For example, learning latent dependency tree, latent parser must choose among exponentially large set possible trees; what's more, parser may learn gradient information downstream task. If highest-scoring tree selected using argmax operation, gradients zero, preventing learning. One strategy dealing null gradient issue use surrogate gradient, explicitly overriding zero gradient chain rule, different computation performed. The commonly known example straight-through estimator \citep[STE;][]{bengio2013estimating}, pretends argmax node instead identity operator. Such methods lead fundamental mismatch objective learning algorithm. The effect mismatch still insufficiently understood, design successful new variants therefore challenging. For example, recently-proposed SPIGOT method found beneficial use projection part surrogate gradient. In paper, study surrogate gradient methods deterministic learning discrete structured latent variables. Our contributions are: While discrete methods outperform relaxed alternatives using building \linebreak blocks, hope interpretation insights would trigger future latent structure research.

Our methods take step direction creating agents infers rewards themselves. We expect improvements applicable similar text-based domains, task-oriented dialogue. Given rapid improvements NLP methods, believe better pre-training sentiment analysis models translate better RL agents future."," Latent structure models are a powerful tool for modeling language data: they can mitigate the error propagation and annotation bottleneck in pipeline systems, while simultaneously uncovering linguistic insights about the data. One challenge with end-to-end training of these models is the argmax operation, which has null gradient. In this paper, we focus on surrogate gradients, a popular strategy to deal with this problem. We explore latent structure learning through the angle of pulling back the downstream learning objective. In this paradigm, we discover a principled motivation for both the straight-through estimator  as well as the recently-proposed SPIGOT---a variant of STE for structured models. Our perspective leads to new algorithms in the same family. We empirically compare the known and the novel pulled-back estimators against the popular alternatives, yielding new insight for practitioners and revealing intriguing failure cases."

Current practice involves taking full model amassed general knowledge fine-tuning second objective appropriate new task \citep[see][for overview]{raffelExploringLimitsTransfer2019}.

"Interactive systems capable understanding natural language responding form natural language text high potentials various applications. In pursuit building evaluating systems, study learning agents Interactive Fiction games. IF games world-simulating software players use text commands control protagonist influence world, illustrated Figure. IF gameplay agents need simultaneously understand game's information text display generate natural language command via text input interface. Without providing explicit game strategy, agents need identify behaviors maximize objective-encoded cumulative rewards. IF games composed human-written texts create superb new opportunities studying evaluating natural language understanding techniques due unique characteristics. Game designers elaborately craft literariness narrative texts attract players creating IF games. The resulted texts IF games linguistically diverse sophisticated template-generated ones synthetic text games. The language contexts IF games versatile various designers contribute enormous domains genres, adventure, fantasy, horror, sci-fi. The text commands control characters less restricted, sizes six orders magnitude larger previous text games. The recently introduced Jericho benchmark provides collection IF games. The complexity IF games demands sophisticated NLU techniques used synthetic text games. Moreover, task designing IF game-play agents, intersecting NLU reinforcement learning , poses several unique challenges NLU techniques. The first challenge difficulty exploration extbf{the huge natural language action space}. To make RL agents learn efficiently %via trial-and-error without prohibitive exhaustive trials, action estimation must generalize learned knowledge tried actions others. To end, previous approaches, starting single embedding vector observation, either predict elements actions independently; embed valid action another vector predict action value based vector-space similarities. These methods consider compositionality role-differences action elements, interactions among observation. Therefore, modeling action values less accurate less data-efficient. The second challenge extbf{partial observability}. At game-playing step, agent receives textual observation describing locations, objects, characters game world. But latest observation often sufficient summary interaction history may provide enough information determine long-term effects actions. Previous approaches address problem building representation past observations . These methods treat historical observations equally summarize information single vector without focusing important contexts related action prediction current observation. Therefore, usages history also bring noise, improvement always significant. We propose novel formulation IF game playing Multi-Passage Reading Comprehension harness MPRC techniques solve huge action space partial observability challenges. The graphical illustration shown Figure. First, action value prediction essentially generating scoring compositional action structure finding supporting evidence observation. We base fact action instantiation template, i.e., verb phrase placeholders object arguments takes~. Then action generation process viewed extracting objects template's placeholders textual observation, based interaction template verb phrase relevant context objects observation. Our approach addresses structured prediction interaction problems idea context-question attention mechanism RC models. Specifically, treat observation passage template verb phrase question. The filling object placeholders template thus becomes extractive QA problem selects objects observation given template. Simultaneously action gets evaluation value predicted RC model. Our formulation approach better capture fine-grained interactions observation texts structural actions, contrast previous approaches represent observation single vector ignore fine-grained dependency among action elements. Second, alleviating partial observability essentially enhancing current observation potentially relevant history predicting actions enhanced observation. Our approach retrieves potentially relevant historical observations object-centric approach , retrieved ones likely connected current observation describe least one shared interactable object. Our attention mechanisms applied across retrieved multiple observation texts focus informative contexts action value prediction. We evaluated approach suite Jericho IF games, compared previous approaches. Our approaches achieved outperformed state-of-the-art performance 25 33 games, trained less one-tenth game interaction data used prior art.

In contrast to previous text games with mostly synthetic texts, IF games pose language understanding challenges on the human-written textual descriptions of diverse and sophisticated game worlds and language generation challenges on the action command generation from less restricted combinatorial space. We take a novel perspective of IF game solving and re-formulate it as Multi-Passage Reading Comprehension  tasks. Our approaches utilize the context-query attention mechanisms and the structured prediction in MPRC to efficiently generate and evaluate action outputs and apply an object-centric historical observation retrieval strategy to mitigate the partial observability of the textual observations.  Extensive experiments on the recent IF benchmark  demonstrate clear advantages of our approaches achieving high winning rates and low data requirements compared to all previous approaches.\footnote{Source code is available at: \url{https://github.com/XiaoxiaoGuo/rcdqn}. }"
"Recent advances self-supervised pre-training resulted impressive downstream performance several NLP tasks.

Training such models on commodity hardware  often means slow convergence, making it practically intractable for many researchers.  In this paper, we propose a simple and effective technique to allow for efficient self-supervised learning with bi-directional Transformers. Our approach is motivated by recent studies demonstrating that self-attention patterns in trained models contain a majority of non-linguistic regularities. We propose a computationally efficient auxiliary loss function to guide attention heads to conform to such patterns. Our method is agnostic to the actual pre-training objective and results in faster convergence of models as well as better performance on downstream tasks compared to the baselines, achieving state of the art results in low-resource settings. Surprisingly, we also find that linguistic properties of attention heads are not necessarily correlated with language modeling performance.\footnote{Code: \href{https://github.com/ameet-1997/AttentionGuidance}{https://github.com/ameet-1997/AttentionGuidance}}"

"Intent Detection crucial task natural language understanding, whose objective extract underlying intents behind given utterances. The extracted intents could provide contexts downstream Natural Language Processing tasks dialogue state tracking question answering. Unlike traditional text classification, ID challenging two main reasons Utterances usually short diversely expressed, Emerging intents occur continuously, especially across different domains . Despite recent advances, state-of-the-art ID methods require large amount annotated data achieve competitive performance. This requirement inhibits models' capability generalizing newly emerging intents limited annotations inference. Re-training fine-tuning large models samples emerging classes could easily lead overfitting problems. Motivated human capability correctly categorizing new classes examples , few-shot learning paradigms adopted tackle scarcity problems emerging classes. FSL methods take advantage small set labeled examples learn discriminate unlabeled samples classes, even seen training. Recent works FSL focus learning matching information labeled samples unlabeled samples provide additional contextual information instance-level representations, leading effective prototype representation. However, methods extract similarity based fine-grained word semantics, failing capture diverse expressions users' utterances. This problem could lead overfitting either seen intents novel intents, especially challenging Generalized Few-shot Intent Detection setting seen novel intents existent joint label space inference. Instead, matching support query samples coarser-grained semantic components could provide additional informative contexts beyond word levels. For instance, two utterances ""i need get table pub southeastern cuisine"" ``book spot six friends"" share similar intent label ``Book Restaurant"". While word-level semantics might find similar action words ``get"" ``book"", words necessarily contribute correct intent findings. Instead, coarser-grained semantics ``get table"" ``book spot"" could provide hints identify ``Book Restaurant"" intent. As semantic components could effectively extracted multi-head self-attention, matching SC support query enhance query support representations, leading improvements generalization seen training classes unseen testing classes. To enhance dynamics extracted SC across various domains diversely expressed utterances, introduce additional head regularizations. In addition, overcome insufficiency single similarity measure matching sentences diverse semantics, comprehensive matching method explored.

Although recent works demonstrate that multi-level matching plays an important role in transferring learned knowledge from seen training classes to novel testing classes, they rely on a static similarity measure and overly fine-grained matching components. These limitations inhibit generalizing capability towards Generalized Few-shot Learning settings where both seen and novel classes are co-existent. In this paper, we propose a novel Semantic Matching and Aggregation Network where semantic components are distilled from utterances via multi-head self-attention with additional dynamic regularization constraints. These semantic components capture high-level information, resulting in more effective matching between instances. Our multi-perspective matching method provides a comprehensive matching measure to enhance representations of both labeled and unlabeled instances. We also propose a more challenging evaluation setting that considers classification on the joint all-class label space. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Recently, BERT based models obtained promising performance ACSA task. However, models ignored sentiment aspect category mentioned sentence aggregation sentiments words indicating aspect category. It leads suboptimal performance models. For example Figure, ``drinks'' ``food'' indicate aspect category food. The sentiment food combination sentiments ``drinks'' ``food''.

To detect the sentiment toward a particular aspect category in a sentence, most previous methods first generate an aspect category-specific sentence representation for the aspect category, then predict the sentiment polarity based on the representation. These methods ignore the fact that the sentiment of an aspect category mentioned in a sentence is an aggregation of the sentiments of the words indicating the aspect category in the sentence, which leads to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Instance Multi-Label Learning Network for Aspect-Category sentiment analysis , which treats sentences as bags, words as instances, and the words indicating an aspect category as the key instances of the aspect category. Given a sentence and the aspect categories mentioned in the sentence, AC-MIMLLN first predicts the sentiments of the instances, then finds the key instances for the aspect categories, finally obtains the sentiments of the sentence toward the aspect categories by aggregating the key instance sentiments. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AC-MIMLLN \footnote{Data and code are available at https://github.com/l294265421/AC-MIMLLN}."

"Conditional random fields shown perform well various sequence labeling tasks. Recent work uses rich neural network architectures define ``unary'' potentials, i.e., terms consider single position's label time~. However, ``binary'' potentials, consider pairs adjacent labels, usually quite simple may consist solely parameter parameter vector unique label transition. Models unary binary potentials generally referred ``first order'' models. A major challenge CRFs complexity training inference, quadratic number output labels first order models grow exponentially higher order dependencies considered. This explains common type CRF used practice first order model, also referred ``linear chain'' CRF. One promising alternative CRFs structured prediction energy networks , use deep neural networks parameterize arbitrary potential functions structured prediction.

Naively instantiating high-order energy terms lead large number parameters learn, instead develop concise neural parameterizations high-order terms. In particular, draw vectorized Kronecker products, convolutional networks, recurrent networks, self-attention. We also consider ``skip-chain'' connections~ various skip distances ways reducing total parameter count increased learnability. Our experimental results four sequence labeling tasks show range high-order energy functions yield performance improvements.

Researchers are increasingly applying deep representation learning to these problems, but the structured component of these approaches is usually quite simplistic. In this work, we propose several high-order energy terms to capture complex dependencies among labels in sequence labeling, including several that consider the entire label sequence. We use neural parameterizations for these energy terms, drawing from convolutional, recurrent, and self-attention networks. We use the framework of learning energy-based inference networks for dealing with the difficulties of training and inference with such models. We empirically demonstrate that this approach achieves substantial improvement using a variety of high-order energy terms on four sequence labeling tasks, while having the same decoding speed as simple, local classifiers.  We also find high-order energies to help in noisy data conditions.\footnote{Code  is available at \url{https://github.com/tyliupku/Arbitrary-Order-Infnet}}"

"Since early days NLP, conversational agents designed interact humans language solve diverse tasks, e.g., remote instructions booking assistants . In goal-oriented dialogue setting, conversational agents often designed compose predefined language utterances. Even approaches efficient, also tend narrow agent's language diversity.

In setting, agents generally trained two-stage process: Firstly, agent pretrained human-labeled corpus supervised learning generate grammatically reasonable sentences. Secondly, agent finetuned maximize task-completion score interacting user. Due sample-complexity reproducibility issues, user generally replaced game simulator may evolve conversational agent.

When word-based conversational agents are trained towards completing a task, they tend to invent their language rather than leveraging natural language. In recent literature, two general methods partially counter this phenomenon: Supervised Selfplay  and Seeded Iterated Learning .  While S2P jointly trains interactive and supervised losses to counter the drift, SIL changes the training dynamics to prevent language drift from occurring. In this paper, we first highlight their respective weaknesses, i.e., late-stage training collapses and higher negative likelihood when evaluated on human corpus. Given these observations, we introduce \longalgo~ to combine both methods to minimize their respective weaknesses.  We then show the effectiveness of \algo in the language-drift translation game."

We address only the second subtask, which targets a data set composed of nearly 30 thousand Swiss German Jodels. The dialect identification task is about accurately predicting the latitude and longitude of test samples. We frame the task as a double regression problem, employing a variety of machine learning approaches to predict both latitude and longitude. From simple models for regression, such as Support Vector Regression, to deep neural networks, such as Long Short-Term Memory networks and character-level convolutional neural networks, and, finally, to ensemble models based on meta-learners, such as XGBoost, our interest is focused on approaching the problem from a few different perspectives, in an attempt to minimize the prediction error. With the same goal in mind, we also considered many types of features, from high-level features, such as BERT embeddings, to low-level features, such as characters n-grams, which are known to provide good results in dialect identification. Our empirical results indicate that the handcrafted model based on string kernels outperforms the deep learning approaches. Nevertheless, our best performance is given by the ensemble model that combines both handcrafted and deep learning models."

"A renewed emphasis must placed sentence fusion context neural abstractive summarization. A majority systems trained end-to-end, abstractive summarizer rewarded generating summaries contain words human abstracts, measured automatic metrics ROUGE. A summarizer, however, rewarded correctly fusing sentences. In fact, examined closely, sentences system abstracts generated fusion. For instance, 6\% summary sentences generated Pointer-Gen fusion, whereas human abstracts contain 32\% fusion sentences. Moreover, sentences generated fusion prone errors. They ungrammatical, nonsensical, otherwise ill-formed. There thus urgent need develop neural abstractive summarizers fuse sentences properly. The importance sentence fusion long recognized community era neural text summarization.

Later work, as, builds dependency word graph combining syntactic trees similar sentences, employs integer linear programming decode summary sentence graph. Most studies assumed set similar sentences input, fusion necessary reduce repetition. Nonetheless, humans limit combine similar sentences. In paper, pay particular attention fuse disparate sentences contain fundamentally different content remain related make fusion sensible. In Figure, provide example sentence fusion instance. We address challenge fusing disparate sentences enhancing Transformer architecture points correspondence sentences, devices tie two sentences together coherent text.

It distinct from~\citet{geva-etal-2019-discofuse} connect two sentences discourse markers. Our contributions follows. We present cascade approach neural abstractive summarization separates content selection surface realization. Importantly, approach makes use text highlights intermediate representation; derived one two sentences using coarse-to-fine content selection strategy, passed neural text generator compose summary sentence. A successful cascade approach expected accurately select sentences highlight appropriate amount text, customized domain-specific tasks.","  The ability to fuse sentences is highly attractive for summarization systems because it is an essential step to produce succinct abstracts. However, to date, summarizers can fail on fusing sentences. They tend to produce few summary sentences by fusion or generate incorrect fusions that lead the summary to fail to retain the original meaning.  In this paper, we explore the ability of Transformers to fuse sentences and propose novel algorithms to enhance their ability to perform sentence fusion by leveraging the knowledge of points of correspondence between sentences. Through extensive experiments, we investigate the effects of different design choices on Transformer's performance.

"The recent advances neural machine translation provided research community commercial landscape effective translation models times achieve near-human performance. However, usually holds phrase sentence level. When using models larger units text, paragraphs documents, quality translation may drop considerably terms discourse attributes lexical stylistic consistency. In fact, document-level translation still open challenging problem. The sentences make document unrelated pieces text predicted independently; rather, set sequences linked together complex underlying linguistics aspects, also known discourse . The discourse document includes several properties grammatical cohesion , lexical cohesion , document coherence use discourse connectives . Ensuring translation retain linguistic properties expected significantly improve overall readability flow. However, due limitations current decoder technology, NMT models still bound translate sentence level. In order capture discourse properties source document translation, researchers attempted incorporate contextual information surrounding sentences. Most document-level NMT approaches augment model multiple encoders, extra attention layers memory caches encode surrounding sentences, leave model implicitly learn discourse attributes simply minimizing conventional NLL objective. The hope model spontaneously identify retain discourse patterns within source document. Conversely, little work attempted model discourse attributes explicitly. Even evaluation metrics typically used translation BLEU designed assess discourse quality translated documents. For reasons, paper propose training NMT model directly targeting two specific discourse metrics: lexical cohesion coherence . LC measure frequency semantically-similar words co-occurring document . For example, car, vehicle, engine wheels semantically-related terms. There significant empirical evidence ensuring lexical cohesion text eases understanding . At turn, COH measures well adjacent sentences text linked other. In following example Hobbs \shortcite{hobbs1979coherence}: two sentences make little `sense' one another. An incoherent text, even grammatically syntactically perfect, anecdotally difficult understand therefore coherence actively pursued. Relevant translation, Vasconcellos \shortcite{vasconcellos1989cohesion} found high percentage human post-editing changes machine-generated translations involves improvement cohesion coherence. Several LC COH metrics well correlate human judgement proposed literature. However, like BLEU evaluation metrics, discrete, non-differentiable functions model's parameters.

Performing sentence fusion accurately succinctly especially important summarizing long documents book chapters. These domains may contain entities events potentially confuse summarizer, making method explicitly marking entities beneficial.","   Document-level machine translation focuses on the translation of entire documents from a source to a target language. It is widely regarded as a challenging task since the translation of the individual sentences in the document needs to retain aspects of the discourse at document level. However, document-level translation models are usually not trained to explicitly ensure discourse quality. Therefore, in this paper we propose a training approach that explicitly optimizes two established discourse metrics, lexical cohesion  and coherence , by using a reinforcement learning objective. Experiments over four different language pairs and three translation domains have shown that our training approach has been able to achieve more cohesive and coherent document translations than other competitive approaches, yet without compromising the faithfulness to the reference translation. In the case of the Zh-En language pair, our method has achieved an improvement of $2.46$ percentage points  in LC and $1.17$ pp in COH over the runner-up, while at the same time improving $0.63$ pp in BLEU score and $0.47$ pp in $\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{BERT}}$.      %In fact, in some cases our training approach has even improved translation accuracy metrics such as BLEU and the recently proposed $F_{\text{BERT}}$."
"In recent years, neural models led state-of-the-art results machine translation . Many systems broadly characterized following multi-layer encoder-decoder neural network design: encoder decoder learn representations word sequences stack layers , building interesting line work improving models. The simplest increases model capacity widening network, whereas recent work shows benefits stacking layers encoder side. For example, popular Transformer model , deep systems shown promising BLEU improvements either easing information flow network constraining gradient norm across layers . An improved system even learn 35-layer encoder, deeper vanilla Transformer . Although methods enabled training deep neural MT models, questions remain nature problem. The main question is: deep networks help NMT. Note previous work evaluates systems black-box manner . It thus natural study much deep NMT system able learn different shallow counterpart. Beyond this, training extremely deep model expensive although narrow-and-deep network speed training . For example, takes us longer time train model deepen network 6 layers 48 layers. This might prevent us exploiting deeper models large-scale systems. In paper, explore deep architectures work render learning NMT models effectively. By investigating change hidden states different layers, find new representations learned continually stacking layers top base model. More stacked layers lead stronger model representing sentence.

Moreover, why deep models help NMT is an open question. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of a well-tuned deep Transformer system. We find that stacking layers is helpful in improving the representation ability of NMT models and adjacent layers perform similarly. This inspires us to develop a shallow-to-deep training method that learns deep models by stacking shallow models. In this way, we successfully train a Transformer system with a 54-layer encoder. Experimental results on WMT'16 English-German and WMT'14 English-French translation tasks show that it is $1.4$ $\times$ faster than training from scratch, and achieves a BLEU score of $30.33$ and $43.29$ on two tasks.

"Task-oriented dialogue systems complete tasks users, making hotel reservation finding train routes, multi-turn conversation . The generated system utterances naturally sound, importantly informative, i.e., proceed dialogue towards task completion. To fulfill requirement, conditioned response generation widely adopted based system actions .

For example, sentiment sentence ``The movie starts competent turn bland'' revealed word ``bland'' identified salient considering complete context. In scenarios, consider measuring word saliency terms state transitions.

By incorporating memory component dialogue state tracking model, use system utterance query perform memory retrieval, retrieval results considered salient words. The retrieval results might contain words redundant since direct supervision retrieval operations. For example, resulting salient words might ``but turn bland'' example shown earlier, include unnecessary words may lead degenerated action results. To obtain compact action representations, propose auxiliary task based pseudo parallel corpus, i.e., dialogue context state annotation pairs. We observe dialogue states serve good examples compact representation be. Therefore, use encoded dialogue context query ask memory component reconstruct text-based dialogue states. In way, obtained concise actions generalize better easily interpreted.

Furthermore, -RPR-24L achieves BLEU score WMT'16 English-German task, speeds training .","   Response generation for task-oriented dialogues implicitly optimizes two objectives at the same time: task completion and language quality. Conditioned response generation serves as an effective approach to separately and better optimize these two objectives.  Such an approach relies on system action annotations which are expensive to obtain. To alleviate the need of action annotations, latent action learning is introduced to map each utterance to a latent representation. However, this approach is prone to over-dependence on the training data, and the generalization capability is thus restricted.   To address this issue, we propose to learn natural language actions that represent utterances as a span of words.  This explicit action representation promotes generalization via the compositional structure of language. It also enables an explainable generation process. Our proposed unsupervised approach learns a memory component to summarize system utterances into a short span of words. To further promote a compact action representation, we propose an auxiliary task that restores state annotations as the summarized dialogue context using the memory component. Our proposed approach outperforms latent action baselines on MultiWOZ, a benchmark multi-domain dataset."

For spoken language, the mismatch in style also extends to prosodic cues, though it is less well understood.  This paper re-examines the use of written text in parsing speech in the context of recent advances in neural language processing. We show that neural approaches facilitate using written text to improve  parsing of spontaneous speech, and that prosody further improves over this state-of-the-art result. Further, we find an asymmetric degradation from read vs.\ spontaneous mismatch, with spontaneous speech more generally useful for training parsers.  %  Prosodic information in the speech signal has been shown to correlate with syntactic structure of a sentence; however, the impact of prosody on parsing has been mixed. Recent results show a benefit for conversational speech, particularly in utterances with disfluencies, but there is little recent work on other speaking styles. In this work, we extend recent advances in constituency parsing of spontaneous speech, integrating acoustic-prosodic cues and achieving SOTA results on the Switchboard dataset. We then explore the performance of the parser on mismatched training/testing scenarios. Specifically, we show that training on spontaneous speech results in a small degradation when testing on read speech, while fine-tuning with WSJ read speech substantially degrades the performance on spontaneous speech."
"The recent progress machine translation models led researchers question use n-gram overlap metrics BLEU, focus solely surface-level aspects generated text, thus may correlate poorly human evaluation. This led surge interest flexible metrics use machine learning capture semantic-level information. Popular examples metrics include YiSi-1, ESIM, BERTscore, Sentence Mover's Similarity, \BLEURT{}. These metrics utilize contextual embeddings large models BERT shown capture linguistic information beyond surface-level aspects. The WMT Metrics 2020 Shared Task reference benchmark evaluating metrics context machine translation. It tests evaluation systems to-English languages , requires multilingual approach. An additional challenge learned metrics human ratings available language pairs, therefore, models must use unlabeled data perform zero-shot generalization.

Assessing utility prosody different speaking styles, found parsers trained spontaneous prosody consistently useful, improving text-only counterparts testing conversational read speech. Fine-tuning parsers read speech improves results testing read style, degrades significantly spontaneous speech. This suggests conversational speech data useful general parser training."," The quality of machine translation systems has dramatically improved over the last decade, and as a result, evaluation has become an increasingly challenging problem. This paper describes our contribution to the WMT 2020 Metrics Shared Task, the main benchmark for automatic evaluation of translation. We make several submissions based on \BLEURT{}, a previously published metric which uses transfer learning. We extend the metric beyond English and evaluate it on 14 language pairs for which fine-tuning data is available, as well as 4 ``zero-shot'' language pairs, for which we have no labelled examples. Additionally, we focus on English to German and demonstrate how to combine \BLEURT{}'s predictions with those of YiSi and use alternative reference translations to enhance the performance. Empirical results show that the models achieve competitive results on the WMT Metrics 2019 Shared Task, indicating their promise for the 2020 edition."

However, majority of existing methods roughly use all context sentences in a fixed scope. They neglect the fact that different source sentences need different sizes of context. To address this problem, we propose an effective approach to select dynamic context so that the document-level translation model can utilize the more useful selected context sentences to produce better translations. Specifically, we introduce a selection module that is independent of the translation module to score each candidate context sentence. Then, we propose two strategies to explicitly select a variable number of context sentences and feed them into the translation module. We train the two modules end-to-end via reinforcement learning. A novel reward is proposed to encourage the selection and utilization of dynamic context sentences. Experiments demonstrate that our approach can select adaptive context sentences for different source sentences, and significantly improves the performance of document-level translation methods."

Moreover, two graph convolutional networks leveraged learn latent representations depicting sessions interact one another terms users, posts correlated terms words. Specifically, address several challenges work: perform explainable cyberbullying detection boost detection performance, highlight explainable comments without ground truth, model correlation posted text user comments, model interactions sessions terms users, interactions textual posts terms words. Our solutions challenges result novel framework HENIN. Our contributions summarized follows. % In paper, propose novel self-paced learning model NMT learning schedule determined model rather intuitively predefined humans. Experimental results three translation tasks verify universal effectiveness approach. Quantitative analyses confirm exploiting self-paced strategy presents flexible way facilitate model convergence CL counterparts. It interesting combine techniques improve NMT. Besides, idea limited machine translation, also interesting validate model NLP tasks, low-resource NMT model training neural architecture search."," In the computational detection of cyberbullying, existing work largely focused on building generic classifiers that rely exclusively on text analysis of social media sessions. Despite their empirical success, we argue that a critical missing piece is the model explainability, i.e., why a particular piece of media session is detected as cyberbullying. In this paper, therefore, we propose a novel deep model, HEterogeneous Neural Interaction Networks , for explainable cyberbullying detection. HENIN contains the following components: a comment encoder, a post-comment co-attention sub-network, and session-session and post-post interaction extractors. Extensive experiments conducted on real datasets exhibit not only the promising performance of HENIN, but also highlight evidential comments so that one can understand why a media session is identified as cyberbullying."

However, many real world scenarios, large-scale labeled data unavailable manually annotating data large scale prohibitively expensive. \zc{merge paragraph 1 2} To address label scarcity bottleneck, study problem using heuristic rules train neural text classifiers. While domain experts \zc{not necessarily domain experts, also KBs.} often cannot afford annotate millions documents carefully, easily provide set heuristic rules weak supervision signals. Using rules automatically induce labeled data model training , meanwhile introduces two major challenges: label noise low label coverage. %The first challenge label noise. The label noise issue arises heuristic rules often simple capture rich contexts complex patterns text classification. For instance, rule `expensive \ negative' restaurant ranking correct times, sometimes wrong delicious food deserves high price. Seed rules limited coverage real-life text corpora often long-tail distributions, many heuristic rules defined frequent keywords, instances containing long-tail keywords cannot covered given rules. \zc{can merge previous paragraph shorten it.} There studies attempt use weak supervision deep text classification. Unfortunately, performance limited two challenges. Ratner \etal proposed data programming method, uses heuristic rules labeling functions trains discriminative models using automatically created labeled data. However, training data annotated data programming come instances directly matched rules, making model limited performance unmatched data. Meng \etal proposed deep self-training method, uses weak supervision learn initial model updates model using model's confident predictions. However, self-training procedure overfit label noise suffer error propagation. \sep Our contributions. We propose new method uses weak supervision train deep text classifiers label-efficient way, addressing label noise label coverage issues. We assume multiple weak supervision sources provide complementary sets heuristic rules. \zc{the previous two sentences merged.} Our idea complementary information multiple sources reduce label noise, also effectively bootstrap unlabeled data improve label coverage, making possible learn accurate deep text classifier weak supervision. Motivated above, propose model two carefully designed components. The first component rule-based classifier \zc{ rule reliability estimators} using conditional soft attention mechanism. Given weak labels annotators document representations, learn reliability scores labeling sources, emphasize weak annotators' opinions informative particular corpus. We use reliability scores aggregate disparate weak labels denoised pseudo label. \zc{need highlight rule reliability conditional input text features} The second component neural classifier learns labels distributed feature representations samples, matched unmatched. This neural classifier supervised denoised labels confident predictions unmatched data, enabling solve rule coverage problem simultaneously enhancing rule denoiser via patterns present unmatched data. The two components integrated end-to-end training framework. \zc{maybe also say use pre-trained BERT feature extractor: representation power help denoiser work better.} We evaluate model four text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis, topic classification, spam classification, information extraction.

We study the problem of learning neural text classifiers without using any labeled data, but only easy-to-provide rules as multiple weak supervision sources. This problem is challenging because rule-induced weak labels are often noisy and incomplete. To address these two challenges, we design a label denoiser, which estimates the source reliability using a conditional soft attention mechanism and then reduces label noise by aggregating rule-annotated weak labels. The denoised pseudo labels then supervise a neural classifier to predicts soft labels for unmatched samples, which address the rule coverage issue. % To address these challenges, we % propose an end-to-end model with two key components \zc{this sentence is not %   informative enough, need to deliver the key idea of our method in one sentence % here, and then use the remaining sentences to elaborate our idea.}.

"Systematic reviews part field evidence-based analysis, methodology conducting literature surveys, focus comprehensively summarising synthesising existing research purpose answering research questions . The aim process broad coverage avoid unknown bias creeping results via alternative cherry-picking scientific results . %As many relevant documents possible included, process also thoroughly documented aid replicability. Conducting systematic reviews requires trained researchers domain knowledge. The stages process time-consuming, vary much physical mental labour require . As result, systematic reviews suffer three primary challenges : So though systematic reviews shown effective less prone human biases , issues often prove prohibitive. \\ However, challenges well suited Machine Learning solutions, recently increase interest applying NLP process . In paper, investigate feasibility implementing multi-stage human process systematic review Machine Learning pipeline. We construct systematic review pipeline aims assist researchers organisations focusing livestock health various African countries previously performed reviews manually . The pipeline begins scraping articles, classifies whether include review, identifies data extract outputs spreadsheet. We discuss technical options evaluated steps. Pipeline components evaluated intrinsic metrics well pragmatic, extrinsic, considerations time effort saved. While previous work exists surveying applicability various Machine Learning methods toolkits systematic review process apply them, extant studies implement full system analyse trade-offs different methods training data creation, different annotation schemas, human expert hours needed build system, final accuracy.

To goal, particularly experiment low resource scenarios generalisability. We investigate different thresholds training data document classifier different annotation schemas data extraction. We additionally test ability system generalise documents new countries. % also talk needing deep learning resources Key research questions follows: \paragraph{Extraction} Which techniques best identifying extracting desired information? \paragraph{Data Requirements} How much labelled training data needed? Can existing resources leveraged? \paragraph{Re-usability} How generalisable pipeline new diseases countries? \paragraph{Performance} What trade-off pipeline accuracy human time savings? \paragraph{Architecture \& Pre-training} How important model architecture applied extraction tasks?

We demonstrate creation labelled training data sped annotation tools, consideration given balance training examples present within data, since may require less data overall still maintaining good performance. Furthermore, besides automatic information extraction, much labour constructing systematic reviews saved simply automating process searching downloading documents. We empirically demonstrate three month pipeline systematic review automated require little human intervention, acceptable accuracy results.

They are vital to many fields of science and philanthropy, but are very time-consuming and require experts. Yet the three main stages of a systematic review are easily done automatically: searching for documents can be done via APIs and scrapers, selection of relevant documents can be done via binary classification, and extraction of data can be done via sequence-labelling classification. Despite the promise of automation for this field, little research exists that examines the various ways to automate each of these tasks. We construct a pipeline that automates each of these aspects, and experiment with many human-time vs. system quality trade-offs. We test the ability of classifiers to work well on small amounts of data and to generalise to data from countries not represented in the training data. We test different types of data extraction with varying difficulty in annotation, and five different neural architectures to do the extraction. We find that we can get surprising accuracy and generalisability of the whole pipeline system with only 2 weeks of human-expert annotation, which is only 15\% of the time it takes to do the whole review manually and can be repeated and extended to new data with no additional effort.\footnote{\hspace{0.1cm}Code and links to models available at \url{https://github.com/seraphinatarrant/systematic_reviews}}"
"Although recent neural models language made advances learning syntactic behavior, research continues suggest inductive bias plays key role data efficiency human-like syntactic generalization . Based long-held observation language exhibits hierarchical structure, previous work proposed coupling recurrent neural networks differentiable stack data structures give computational power pushdown automata , class automata recognize context-free languages . However, previously proposed differentiable stack data structures model deterministic stacks, store one version stack contents time, theoretically limiting power stack RNNs deterministic~CFLs. A sentence's syntactic structure often cannot fully resolved conclusion , requiring human listener track multiple possibilities hearing sentence. Past work psycholinguistics suggested models keep multiple candidate parses memory explain human reading times better models assume harsher computational constraints. This ability also plays important role calculating expectations facilitate efficient language processing . Current neural language models track multiple parses, learn syntax generalizations . We propose new differentiable stack data structure explicitly models nondeterministic PDA, adapting algorithm \citet{lang:1974} reformulating terms tensor operations. The algorithm able represent exponential number stack configurations using cubic time quadratic space complexity. As existing stack RNN architectures, combine data structure RNN controller, call resulting model \ourmodel{} . We predict nondeterminism help language processing two ways. First, improve trainability, since possible sequences stack operations contribute objective function, sequence used current model. Second, improve expressivity, able model concurrent parses ways deterministic stack cannot. We demonstrate claims comparing \om{} deterministic stack RNNs formal language modeling tasks varying complexity. To show nondeterminism aids training, show \om{} achieves lower cross-entropy, fewer parameter updates, deterministic CFLs. To show nondeterminism improves expressivity, show \om{} achieves lower cross-entropy nondeterministic CFLs, including ``hardest context-free language"" , language least difficult parse CFL inherently requires nondeterminism.

"Neural network language models , pretrained vast amounts raw text, become dominant input downstream tasks . Commonly, tasks involve aspects language comprehension . One explicit example coreference resolution, wherein anaphora linked antecedents requiring knowledge syntax, semantics, world-knowledge match human-like comprehension. Recent work suggested LMs acquire abstract, often human-like, knowledge syntax \cite[e.g.,][]{gulordavaetal18, futrelletal2018, huetal2020-systematic}. Additionally, knowledge grammatical referential aspects linking pronoun antecedent noun demonstrated transformer long short-term memory architectures . Humans able modulate referential syntactic comprehension given abstract linguistic knowledge . Contrary humans, find discourse structure influences LM behavior reference, syntax, despite model representations encode necessary discourse information. The particular discourse structure examined governed implicit causality verbs . Such verbs influence pronoun comprehension: \ex. \a. Sally frightened Mary terrifying. \b. Sally feared Mary terrifying. In , agrees gender Sally Mary, possible antecedents. However, English speakers overwhelmingly interpret referring Sally Mary , despite semantic overlap verbs. Verbs subject preference called subject-biased IC verbs, verbs object preference called object-biased IC verbs. In addition pronoun resolution, IC verbs also interact relative clause attachment: \ex. \a. John babysits children musician who... \a. ...lives La Jolla. \b. ...are students private school. \z. \b. John detests children musician who... \a. ...lives La Jolla. \b. ...are arrogant rude. \z. \z. \citep[from][]{rohdeetal2011} In , sentence fragments possible continuations modifying musician continuations modifying children . We might expect human continuation preferences . However, use object-biased IC verb increases proportion continuations given human participants refer children . Without object-biased IC verb majority continuations refer recent noun . Effects IC received renewed interest field psycholinguistics recent years \cite[e.g.,][]{kehler2008coherence, ferstl2011implicit, hartshorne2013verb, hartshorne2014, williams_IC_2020}. Current accounts IC claim phenomenon inherently linguistic process, rely additional pragmatic inferences comprehenders \cite[e.g.,][]{rohdeetal2011, hartshorne2013verb}. Thus, IC argued contained within linguistic signal, analogous evidence syntactic agreement verb argument structure within corpora. We hypothesize claims correct, current LMs able condition reference syntactic attachment IC verbs language data . We tested hypothesis using unidirectional transformer long short-term memory network \citep[LSTM;][]{hochreiterschmidhuber97} language models. We find LSTM LMs fail acquire subject/object-biased IC distinction influences reference RC attachment. In contrast, transformers learned representational distinction subject-biased object-biased IC verbs interacts reference RC attachment, distinction influenced model output reference. The apparent failure model syntactic behavior exhibit IC contrast present model representations raises questions broader capacity LMs display human-like linguistic knowledge. In work, show possible decipher book-based cipher, using known-plaintext attack neural English language model. We apply method letters written US General James Wilkinson, recover 75.1\ word tokens correctly. We believe word-based neural language models powerful tool decrypting classical codes ciphers. Because much lower perplexities widely-used n-gram models, distinguish candidate plaintexts resemble English distance, versus candidate plaintexts grammatical, sensible, relevant historical context.","  Language models  trained on large quantities of text have been claimed to acquire abstract linguistic representations. Our work tests the robustness of these abstractions by focusing on the ability of LMs to learn interactions between different linguistic representations. In particular, we utilized stimuli from psycholinguistic studies showing that humans can condition reference  and syntactic processing on the same discourse structure . We compared both transformer and long short-term memory LMs to find that, contrary to humans, implicit causality only influences LM behavior for reference, not syntax, despite model representations that encode the necessary discourse information. Our results further suggest that LM behavior can contradict not only learned representations of discourse but also syntactic agreement, pointing to shortcomings of standard language modeling."
"Word ordering often determines meaning sentence; therefore utilize position information word sequence important topic NLP widely investigated recently. A common approach modeling word ordering use recurrent neural networks , long short-term memory gated recurrent unit , use hidden state represent information ordered sequence update model weights backpropagation time ; thus ordering information modeled structure. However, RNN BPTT inefficient modern GPU computation due difficulty parallelization time dependency. To solve problem, recent work, convolutional seq2seq Transformers apply convolutional neural network self-attention respectively, succeed eliminate time dependency take computational advantage GPU. Instead storing information ordered sequences, models utilize position information using feature-level positional encoding. For example, convolutional seq2seq proposed learnable position embeddings represent positions sequence. Recently, various pre-trained Transformer language models keep breaking state-of-the-art results numerous NLP tasks. There many different ways pre-train Transformer language model. For example, using encoder, decoder, whole part Transformer, adapting self-attention masks, training different objectives . However, terms positional encoding, work used learned position embedding originally proposed convolutional seq2seq without analysis, even different objectives may learn completely different position information. Motivated observations, goal investigate position information pre-trained Transformers could learn different settings. We conduct deep analysis learned position embeddings among three iconic pre-trained Transformer language models: BERT , RoBERTa GPT-2 . To examine performance different NLP types, conduct experiments text classification, language modeling, machine translation, empirically analyze explain meaning influence position embeddings different aspects. The contributions paper 3-fold: The present study examined extent discourse structure, determined implicit causality verbs, could acquired transformer LSTM language models . Specifically, evaluated, via comparison human experiments, whether IC verb biases could influence reference syntactic attachment LMs. Analyses conducted two levels granularity: model behavior model representation . Given claims recent literature implicit causality arises without extra pragmatic inference part human comprehenders, hypothesized LMs would able acquire contrasts . We found LSTM LMs unable demonstrate knowledge IC either influencing reference syntax. However, transformer trained exact data LSTM LMs able partially represent IC distinction, model output influenced IC bias resolving reference, syntactic attachment. In evaluating transformer model trained vastly data , found robust, human-like sensitivity IC bias resolving reference: subject-biased IC verbs increased model preference subject pronouns object-biased IC verbs increased model preferences object pronouns. However, mismatch TransformerXL model representation model behavior arose processing syntactic attachment. In contrast results, \citet{davis-van-schijndel-2020b} showed syntactic predictions LSTM LMs influenced aspects discourse structure. A simple explanation conflicting results may LMs examined unable learn syntactic operation attachment, thus influence discourse surface. The erasure number agreement final layers transformer LMs provides compelling evidence towards conclusion.\footnote{Further cross-linguistic evidence bearing inability LSTM LMs, specifically, learn relative clause attachment given \citet{davis-van-schijndel-2020-recurrent}.} From theoretical perspective, present study provides additional support centering implicit causality within linguistic signal proper. That is, IC bias learnable, degree, without pragmatic inference hypothesized Section \cite[see also][]{hartshorne2014}. The mismatches syntactic representations behavior suggest, however, models ignore abstract categories learned, contrary human findings \cite[cf.][]{rohdeetal2011}. We believe solution may lie changing model training objectives . Psycholinguistic studies focusing interaction discourse syntax suggested coherence relations may unit linguistic prediction, contrast next-word prediction used language modeling work \cite[see][]{rohdeetal2011}. We leave future work investigation suggestion well teasing apart exact role training data model architecture play interaction types linguistic representation. \section*{Acknowledgments} Thank members C.Psyd lab Cornell, gave feedback earlier form work.

Many variants of pre-trained Transformers have kept breaking out, and most focus on designing different pre-training objectives or variants of self-attention.  Embedding the position information in the self-attention mechanism is also an indispensable factor in Transformers however is often discussed at will.  Therefore, this paper carries out an empirical study on position embeddings of mainstream pre-trained Transformers, which mainly focuses on two questions: 1) Do position embeddings really learn the meaning of positions? 2) How do these different learned position embeddings affect Transformers for NLP tasks?  This paper focuses on providing a new insight of pre-trained position embeddings through feature-level analysis and empirical experiments on most of iconic NLP tasks. It is believed that our experimental results can guide the future work to choose the suitable positional encoding function for specific tasks given the application property.\footnote{The source code is available at: \url{https://github.com/MiuLab/PE-Study}} %to make our study more convincing."
"Autoregressive sequence sequence models Transformers trained maximize log-likelihood target sequence, conditioned input sequence. Furthermore, approximate inference typically done using beam search algorithm , allows controlled exploration exponential search space. However, seq2seq models suffer discrepancy token level classification learning sequence level inference search. This discrepancy also manifests form curse sentence length i.e. models' proclivity generate shorter sentences inference, received considerable attention literature . In work, focus better model long-tailed phenomena, i.e. predicting long-tail low-frequency words/tokens , seq2seq models, task Neural Machine Translation . Essentially, two mechanisms tokens low frequency receive lower probabilities prediction: firstly, norms embeddings low frequency tokens smaller, means dot-product based softmax operation generate probability distribution vocabulary, receive less probability. This well known Image Classification Neural Language Models . Since NMT shares dot-product softmax operation, observe phenomenon holds true NMT well. For example, observe Spearman閳ユ獨 Rank Correlation 0.43 norms token embeddings frequency, standard transformer model trained IWSLT-14 De-En dataset . Secondly, transformer based NMT, embeddings low frequency tokens lie different subregion space semantically similar high frequency tokens, due different rates updates , thereby, making rare words token embeddings ineffective. Since token embeddings match context vector getting next-token probabilities, dot-product similarity score lower low frequency tokens, even semantically similar high frequency tokens. Further, better modeling long-tailed phenomena significant implications several text generation tasks, well compositional generalization . To end, primarily ask seek answers following two fundamental questions context NMT: By exploring questions, arrive conclusion widely used cross-entropy loss limits NMT models' expressivity inference propose new loss function better incorporate inductive biases beam search.

On hand, Transformer decoders autoregressive language modeling actually learn absolute positions. The empirical experiments pre-trained position embeddings validate hypothesis. We also show different NLP tasks different model architectures different training objectives may utilize position information different ways. As result, believed study benefit future work choosing suitable positional encoding functions designing modeling methods position information target NLP tasks based properties."," State-of-the-art Neural Machine Translation  models struggle with generating low-frequency tokens, tackling which remains a major challenge. The analysis of long-tailed phenomena in the context of structured prediction tasks is further hindered by the added complexities of search during inference. In this work, we quantitatively characterize such long-tailed phenomena at two levels of abstraction, namely, token classification and sequence generation. We propose a new loss function, the Anti-Focal loss, to better adapt model training to the structural dependencies of conditional text generation by incorporating the inductive biases of beam search in the training process. We show the efficacy of the proposed technique on a number of Machine Translation  datasets, demonstrating that it leads to significant gains over cross-entropy across different language pairs, especially on the generation of low-frequency words. We have released the code to reproduce our results.\blfootnote{The first author is now a researcher at Microsoft, USA.}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/vyraun/long-tailed}} %"

"Deep learning become dominant approach address Natural Language Processing tasks, including text classification. With sufficient high-quality training data, deep learning models perform incredibly well . However, real-world cases, ideal datasets scarce. Often times, available datasets small, full regular irrelevant words, contain unintended biases . These lead suboptimal models undesirable properties. For example, models may biases sub-populations may work effectively wild overfit imperfect training data. To improve models, previous work looked different techniques beyond standard model fitting. If weaknesses training datasets models anticipated, strategies tailored mitigate weaknesses. For example, augmenting training data gender-swapped input texts helps reduce gender bias models . Adversarial training prevent models exploiting irrelevant and/or protected features . With limited number training examples, using human rationales prior knowledge together training labels help models perform better . Nonetheless, side-effects sub-optimal datasets cannot predicted found training thanks post-hoc error analysis. To rectify problems, attempts enable humans fix trained models . Since models usually complex understand, manually modifying model parameters possible. Existing techniques, therefore, allow humans provide feedback individual predictions instead.

Furthermore, existing techniques allow us rectify errors related examples hand provide way fix problems kept hidden model parameters. In paper, propose framework allows humans debug improve deep text classifiers disabling hidden features irrelevant classification task. We name framework FIND . FIND exploits explanation method, namely layer-wise relevance propagation , understand behavior classifier predicts training instance.

This enables humans comprehend features automatically learned deep classifier decide disable features could undermine prediction accuracy testing. The main differences work existing work are: first, FIND leverages human feedback model components, individual predictions, perform debugging; second, FIND targets deep text classifiers convoluted traditional classifiers used existing work . We conducted three human experiments demonstrate usefulness FIND.

Section proposes FIND, debugging framework. Section explains experimental setup followed three human experiments Section . Finally, Section discusses generalization framework concludes paper. Code datasets paper available \url{https://github.com/plkumjorn/FIND}. In summary, model shows basic self-consistency task constituency parsing, consistently able correctly identify certain constituents . All results show unique design model brings us closer developing consistently powerful unsupervised parsing models. However, experiments show struggles internal structures complex NPs, often overestimates height split points right verbs. Based analysis, hypothesize failures least partially attributed use unidirectional language modelling training task. There two potential problems training task. First, motivation language modelling generally perfectly match target task constituency parsing, since cross-constituent hints sometimes helpful, revealed . Second, hard unidirectional model correctly identify high-level constituents, revealed . Therefore, believe promising research direction build latent tree learning models based bidirectional model architectures like transformer task acceptability judgement dataset like CoLA , syntax-related sentence-level task requires model predict whether input sentence grammatically acceptable. Another option consider masked language modelling also bidirectional task much easier scale compared acceptability judgement since self-supervised task."," Since obtaining a perfect training dataset  is hardly possible, many real-world text classifiers are trained on the available, yet imperfect, datasets.  These classifiers are thus likely to have undesirable properties. For instance, they may have biases against some sub-populations or may not work effectively in the wild due to overfitting.  In this paper, we propose FIND -- a framework which enables humans to debug deep learning text classifiers by disabling irrelevant hidden features. Experiments show that by using FIND, humans can improve CNN text classifiers which were trained under different types of imperfect datasets ."
"% Neural dependency parsers predicts relations interactions words equipped nerual networks. Graph-based dependency parsing popular approach dependency parsing scores parse components sentence finds highest scoring tree inference. First-order graph-based dependency parsing takes individual dependency edges components parse tree, higher-order dependency parsing considers complex components consisting multiple edges.

"Neural summarizers achieved impressive performance evaluated ROUGE ~ in-domain setting, recent success pre-trained models drives state-of-the-art results benchmarks new level ~. However, superior performance guarantee perfect system since exsiting models tend show defects evaluated aspects. For example, \citet{zhang-etal-2018-abstractiveness} observes many abstractive systems tend near-extractive practice. \citet{cao2018faithful,wang2020asking,kryscinski2019evaluating,maynez2020faithfulness,durmus2020feqa} reveal generated summaries factually incorrect. These non-mainstream evaluation methods make easier identify model's weaknesses. Orthogonal two evaluation aspects, aim diagnose limitation existing systems cross-dataset evaluation, summarization system trained one corpus would evaluated range out-of-dataset corpora. Instead evaluating quality summarizers solely based one dataset multiple datasets individually, cross-dataset evaluation enables us evaluate model performance different angle. For example, Fig. shows ranking summarization systems studied paper different evaluation metrics, ranking list `` in-dataset R2'' obtained traditional ranking criteria two based designed cross-dataset measures. Intuitively, observe 1) different definitions ``good'' system various evaluation aspects; 2) abstractive extractive systems exhibit diverse behaviors evaluated cross-dataset setting.

However, most existing evaluation methods are limited to an in-domain setting, where summarizers are trained and evaluated on the same dataset. We argue that this approach can narrow our understanding of the generalization ability for different summarization systems. In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of characteristics of different datasets and investigate the performance of different summarization models under a cross-dataset setting, in which a summarizer trained on one corpus will be evaluated on a range of out-of-domain corpora. A comprehensive study of 11 representative summarization systems on 5 datasets from different domains reveals the effect of model architectures and generation ways  on model generalization ability.

"As robots deployed collaborative applications like healthcare household assistance , growing need reliable human-robot communication. One communication modality user-friendly versatile natural language; end, focus robust natural language interfaces map utterances executable behavior . Most existing work NLIs falls static train-then-deploy paradigm: models first trained large datasets pairs deployed, hope reliably generalize new utterances. Yet, happens models make mistakes faced types utterances unseen training --- example, providing household robot novel utterance like ``wash coffee mug?'' Such static systems fail way recover, burdening user find alternate utterances accomplish task . Instead, argue NLIs need dynamic adaptive, learning interactively user feedback index perform complicated behaviors. In work, explore building NLIs simulated robotics learn real humans. Inspired \citet{wang2017naturalizing}, leverage idea learning decomposition learn new abstractions. Just like human interactively teaches new task friend breaking down, users interactively teach system simplifying utterances system cannot understand lower-level utterances . To map language executable behavior, \citet{wang2017naturalizing} \citet{thomason2019improving} built adaptive NLIs leverage grammar-based parsers allow reliable one-shot generalization lack lexical flexibility. For example, grammar-based system understands ``wash coffee mug'' may generalize ``clean mug.'' Meanwhile, recent semantic parsers based primarily neural sequence-to-sequence models . While models excel lexical flexibility perspective, lack ability perform reliable one-shot generalization: difficult train generalize individual examples . In paper propose new interactive NLI lexically flexible reliably efficiently perform one-shot generalization. We introduce novel exemplar-based neural network semantic parser first abstracts away entities , allowing generalization previously taught utterances novel object combinations. Our parser retrieves corresponding ``lifted'' utterance respective program training examples based learned metric , giving us lexical flexibility sequence-to-sequence models. We demonstrate efficacy learning decomposition framework set human-in-the-loop experiments crowdworkers use NLI solve suite simulated robotics tasks household environments. Crucially, completing task, update semantic parser users immediately reuse taught. We show time, users able complete complex tasks efficiently exemplar-based method compared neural sequence-to-sequence baseline. However, straightforward tasks completed fewer steps, see similar performance baseline. We end error analysis discussion user trust incentives context building interactive semantic parsing systems, paving way future work better realizes potential interactive paradigm. By performing comprehensive evaluation eleven summarization systems five mainstream datasets, summarize observations below: 1) Abstractive summarizers extremely brittle compared extractive approaches, maximum gap reaches 37 terms measure stableness defined paper. 2) BART superior abstractive models even comparable extractive models terms stiffness . On hand, robust transferring datasets possesses high stableness . 3) BERT performs excellently terms stiffness, still lacks stableness transferred \texttt{Bigpatent B} datasets. 4) The robustness models improved either equipped model ability copy span source document make use well trained sequence sequence pre-trained model . 5) Simply adding BERT encoder could improve stiffness model cause larger cross-dataset in-dataset performance gap, better way found merge BERT abstractive model, better training strategy applied offset negative influence brings. 6) Existing factuality checker limited predictive power positive samples . 7) Out-of-domain systems even surpass in-domain systems terms factuality.","  Our goal is to create an interactive natural language interface that efficiently and reliably learns from users to complete tasks in simulated robotics settings. We introduce a neural semantic parsing system that learns new high-level abstractions through decomposition: users interactively teach the system by breaking down high-level utterances describing novel behavior into low-level steps that it can understand. Unfortunately, existing methods either rely on grammars which parse sentences with limited flexibility, or neural sequence-to-sequence models that do not learn efficiently or reliably from individual examples. Our approach bridges this gap, demonstrating the flexibility of modern neural systems, as well as the one-shot reliable generalization of grammar-based methods. Our crowdsourced interactive experiments suggest that over time, users complete complex tasks more efficiently while using our system by leveraging what they just taught. At the same time, getting users to trust the system enough to be incentivized to teach high-level utterances is still an ongoing challenge. We end with a discussion of some of the obstacles we need to overcome to fully realize the potential of the interactive paradigm."

In languages grammatical gender dependent social gender human referents. For example, Spanish translation sentence `This doctor', `the doctor' would either `el m鑼卍ico', masculine, `la m鑼卍ica', feminine. Since noun refers person grammatical gender inflection correct given referent. In practice many NMT models struggle generating inflections correctly , often instead defaulting gender-based social stereotypes masculine language . For example, NMT model might always translate `This doctor' sentence masculine inflected noun: `Este es el m鑼卍ico'. Such behaviour viewed translations exhibiting gender bias. By `bias' follow definition behaviour `systematically unfairly discriminate[s] certain individuals groups individuals favor others.' Specifically, translation performance favors referents fitting groups corresponding social stereotypes, male doctors. Such systems propagate representational harm erasure referents -- example, non-male doctor would incorrectly gendered example translation. Systems may also cause allocational harms incorrect translations used inputs systems . System users also experience representational harms via reinforcement stereotypes associating occupations particular gender . Even referent, user may wish words translated way appear endorse social stereotypes. Users also experience lower quality service receiving grammatically incorrect translations. A common approach broad problem NMT use gender features, implicit explicit. The gender one words test sentence determined external context reliance `gender signals' words source sentence gendered pronouns. That information used translating. Such approaches combine two distinct tasks: identifying gender inflection feature, applying translate words source sentence. These feature-based approaches make unstated assumption could correctly identify that, e.g., doctor example female, could inflect entities sentence correctly, reducing effect gender bias. Our contribution exploration assumption. We propose scheme incorporating explicit gender inflection tag NMT, particularly translating coreference sentences reference gender label known. Experimenting translation English Spanish English German, find simple existing approaches overgeneralize gender signal, incorrectly using inflection every entity sentence. We show tagged-coreference adaptation approach effective combatting behaviour. Although work English source sentences extend prior work, note approach extended source languages without inherent gender signals like gendered pronouns, unlike approaches rely signals. Intuitively, gender tagging perform well use label determined human coreference resolution, even less useful gender label must automatically inferred. Conversely, gender tagging effective scenario may beneficial user specify gendered language use referent, Google Translate's translation inflection selection , translations grammatical gender use human referents known. We also find approach works well RoBERTa-based gender tagging English test sentences. Existing work NMT gender bias focused translation sentences based binary gender signals, exclusively male female personal pronouns. This excludes erases use binary gendered language, including limited non-binary individuals . As part work therefore explore applying tagging indicate gender-neutral referents, produce WinoMT set assess translation coreference sentences gender-neutral entities. \subsection{Related work} Variations gender tag signal machine translation proposed several forms. incorporate `speaker gender' tag training data, allowing gender conveyed sentence level. However, allow fine-grained control, example one referent sentence. Similar approaches infer use gender information discourse context. also incorporate single explicit gender feature sentence inference. integrate coreference links machine translation reranking improve pronoun translation cross-sentence context. propose NMT gender bias reduction `mixing signals' addition pro-stereotypical adjectives. Also related work recent approach , train NMT models scratch source language words annotated target language grammatical gender. In treat gender bias domain adaptation problem adapting small set synthetic sentences equal numbers entities using masculine feminine inflections. We also interpret gender `tagging' approach, since gendered terms synthetic dataset give strong signal model. In work extend synthetic datasets work explore effect further. Other approaches reducing gender bias effects involve adjusting word embeddings either directly training counterfactual data augmentation . We view approaches orthogonal proposed scheme: similar goals directly control inference-time gender inflection word sentence level. In paper, explore few-shot learning problem multi-label intent detection. To estimate reasonable threshold support examples, propose Meta Calibrated Threshold adaptively combines prior experience domain-specific knowledge. To obtain label-instance relevance score few-shot setting, introduce metric learning based method Anchored Label Representation. It provides well-separated label representations label-instance similarity calculation. Experiment results validate Meta Calibrated Threshold Anchored Label Representation improve few-shot multi-label intent detection."," Neural Machine Translation  has been shown to struggle with grammatical gender that is dependent on the gender of human referents, which can cause gender bias effects. Many existing approaches to this problem seek to control gender inflection in the target language by explicitly or implicitly adding a gender feature to the source sentence, usually at the sentence level.    In this paper we propose schemes for incorporating explicit word-level gender inflection tags into NMT. We explore the potential of this gender-inflection controlled translation when the gender feature can be determined from a human reference, or when a test sentence can be automatically gender-tagged, assessing on English-to-Spanish and English-to-German translation.  We find that simple existing approaches can over-generalize a gender-feature to multiple entities in a sentence, and suggest effective alternatives in the form of tagged coreference adaptation data. We also propose an extension to assess translations of gender-neutral entities from English given a corresponding linguistic convention, such as a non-binary inflection, in the target language."
"Self-supervised pretraining language modeling massive datasets revolutionized NLP. One reason method works pretraining shapes model's hypothesis space, giving inductive biases help learn linguistic tasks . Numerous probing studies provided support idea showing language models learn representations encode linguistic features . However, feature learning first step acquiring helpful inductive biases. Models must also able learn features matter. The NLU datasets models often fine-tuned ambiguous contain artifacts, often support multiple possible generalizations. Neural networks mind readers: Models shown represent linguistic features sometimes fail use fine-tuning NLU tasks, instead adopting shallow surface generalizations . To end, recent work probing pretrained models advocates shifting focus study away whether represent linguistic features favor whether learn useful representations features . % } \end{table*} We investigate RoBERTa acquires language-specific inductive biases self-supervised pretraining. We track separately RoBERTa's representation linguistic features preferences linguistic generalizations surface generalizations change amount pretraining data increases. We pretrain RoBERTa scratch datasets ranging 1M 1B words evaluate models alongside RoBERTa series experiments probe inductive biases pretrained model time fine-tuning downstream task. We probe models three kinds experiments: First, conduct control experiments fine-tune models unambiguous binary classification tasks test whether learn represent simple linguistic surface features. Second, conduct ambiguous experiments following poverty stimulus design , illustrated Figure . In experiments, fine-tune pretrained model ambiguous binary classification task training set consistent linguistic generalization surface one. We test classifier disambiguating data reveal generalization model adopted, extension preference among two features. Third, conduct inoculation experiments \citep[following][]{liu2019inoculation} test hard sway model surface bias adopt linguistic generalization. We introducing small amounts disambiguating data otherwise ambiguous training set. We automatically generate data tasks, call resulting dataset \dataset\ , pronounced ``messages''. The results show RoBERTa acquires stronger linguistic bias pretraining increases. RoBERTa strongest linguistic bias, requires little inoculating data reliably make linguistic generalization. In general, models pretraining data generally induced adopt linguistic generalizations less inoculating data. We also find large gap amount pretraining data RoBERTa needs learn linguistic features necessary generalize out-of-domain amount needs learns prefer features generalizing. The control experiments unambiguous data reveal models little pretraining actually represent linguistic features, nonetheless show strong surface bias. In words, main contribution pretraining linguistic bias learning devoted extracting features, learning features matter. We conclude helpful inductive biases learned pretraining, current models require abundant data so. The implications conclusion point two directions: First, probably continue pretrain increasingly massive training sets improve generalization few-shot learning abilities models like T5 GPT-3 . Second, since models learn useful features early, hope future advances could accelerate reducing amount data needed learn features matter. To aid effort, release MSGS dataset, pretrained RoBERTas, code: \href{https://github.com/nyu-mll/msgs}{\url{https://github.com/nyu-mll/msgs}}. Tagging words target language gender inflection powerful way improve accuracy translated inflections. This could applied cases correct grammatical gender use given referent known, monolingual coreference resolution tools improve sufficiently used automatic tagging. It also potential application new inflections defined gender-neutral language. However, risk gender features used over-general way. Providing strong gender signal one entity potential harm users referents erasing entities sentence, unless model specifically trained translate sentences multiple entities. In particular find V3 system, trained multiple-entity translation examples, allows good performance minimizing peripheral effects. We conclude emphasising work gender coreference translation requires care ensure effects interventions intended, well testing scenarios capture full complexity problem, work impact gender bias.","   One reason pretraining on self-supervised linguistic tasks is effective is that it teaches models features that are helpful for language understanding. However, we want pretrained models to learn not only to represent linguistic features, but also to use those features preferentially during fine-turning. With this goal in mind, we introduce a new English-language diagnostic set called MSGS , which consists of 20 ambiguous binary classification tasks that we use to test whether a pretrained model prefers linguistic or surface generalizations during fine-tuning. We pretrain RoBERTa models from scratch on quantities of data ranging from 1M to 1B words and compare their performance on \dataset\ to the publicly available RoBERTa$\subtxt{BASE}$. We find that models can learn to represent linguistic features with little pretraining data, but require far more data to learn to prefer linguistic generalizations over surface ones. Eventually, with about 30B words of pretraining data, RoBERTa$\subtxt{BASE}$ does demonstrate a linguistic bias with some regularity. We conclude that while self-supervised pretraining is an effective way to learn helpful inductive biases, there is likely room to improve the rate at which models learn which features matter."

Experiments and manual analyses on newly constructed datasets show that our models have a strong cross-lingual transfer ability and can generate fluent English definitions for Chinese words. We further measure the lexical complexity of generated and reference definitions. The results show that the generated definitions are much simpler, which is more suitable for language learners. %We further conduct a manual analysis of the generated Chinese definitions and find that although these definitions are insufficient on the accuracy, they are already good enough on fluency and lexical complexity."

"\renewcommand{\thefootnote}{} Recurrent Neural Network language models shown learn many aspects natural language syntax including number long-distance dependencies representations incremental syntactic state . However, previous studies investigated relationship token's frequency training corpus syntactic properties models learn it. In work, assess neural models' ability make robust syntactic generalizations token's nominal number verbal argument structure based minimal exposure token training. Because Zipfian distribution words corpus, vast majority word types seen handful times training . Therefore, few-shot learning capabilities neural LMs critical robustness NLP system cognitive model. However, human learning goes beyond simply learning syntactic properties particular constructions. People apply properties across different constructions, meaning representations syntactic features word sense invariant grammatical context word. For example, speakers listeners sensitive verb's argument structure relationships easily recognize verb cannot take direct object active, declarative sentences cannot passivized The relationship active sentence passive sentence termed transformation linguistic literature . Many semantic-syntactic rules govern word co-occurrence one form, verb's argument structure relationships, hold uniformly across transformations. It remains open question whether models learn grammatical rules invariant surface realization, property call syntactic invariance. We combine assessment few-shot learning syntactic invariance two grammatical features English: whether noun singular plural whether verb transitive intransitive . We assess whether model able make different predictions based number argument structure simple active voice base context. We assess whether models able make similar distinctions transformed context---passive voice verbs polar questions nouns. In transformed contexts, test models tokens occur base context training. For models succeed transformed contexts must represent syntactic features way invariant specific realization features terms word co-occurrences different constructions. For grammatical feature, introduce suite novel targeted test sentences, similar presented \citet{marvin2018targeted}. We find neural models tested able induce proper syntactic generalizations base transformed contexts two three exposures, whereas baseline -gram model fails learn relevant generalizations. For constructions tested two neural models enhanced explicit structural supervision outperform purely sequence model. Assessing invariance properties, find neural models demonstrate proper behavior transformed contexts, even tokens seen base contexts training. This behavior indicates models able deploy generalizations learned one syntactic context different syntactic environments, key component human linguistic capabilities far untested neural setting. \subsection{Related Work} Bayesian models word learning shown successes acquiring proper syntactic generalizations minimal exposure , however clear well neural network models would exhibit rapid generalizations. Comparing neural network architectures, recent work shown models enhanced explicit structural supervision training produce humanlike syntactic generalizations , remains untested whether supervision helps learn properties tokens occur rarely training. Previous studies found Artificial Neural Networks capable learning argument structure paradigms make correct predictions across multiple frames , however capabilities remain untested incremental language models. Much written ability ANNs learn number agreement , including ability maintain dependency across different types intervening material coordinated noun phrases . \citet{hu2020systematic} find model architecture, rather training data size, may contribute performance number agreement related tasks. Focusing RNN models, \citet{lakretz2019emergence} find evidence number agreement tracked specific ``number"" units work concert units carry general syntactic information like tree depth. \citet{jumelet2019analysing} argue learning dependencies RNNs acquire default form , predicting non-default form requires explicit contrary evidence. Our results support hypothesis. Models accurate singular nouns transitive verbs seen times training, behavior indicates forms expected evidence sparse. We presented TUPA-MRP modified HIT-SCIR parser, constitute HUJI-KU submission CoNLL 2020 shared task Cross-Framework Meaning Representation. TUPA general transition-based DAG parser uniform transition system, easily adaptable multiple frameworks. We used parsing cross-framework cross-lingual tracks, adapting newly introduced frameworks, PTG DRG. HIT-SCIR transition-based parser framework-specific transition systems, adapted year's shared task used English EDS UCCA parsing cross-framework track. The HIT-SCIR parser additionally used experimenting multitask learning, negative results approach. Future work tackle MRP task modern transition-based-like parser architectures, pointer networks , far applied bilexical framworks, i.e., flavor-0 SDP ."," Humans can learn structural properties about a word from minimal experience, and deploy their learned syntactic representations uniformly in different grammatical contexts. We assess the ability of modern neural language models to reproduce this behavior in English and evaluate the effect of structural supervision on learning outcomes. First, we assess few-shot learning capabilities by developing controlled experiments that probe models' syntactic nominal number and verbal argument structure generalizations for tokens seen as few as two times during training. Second, we assess invariance properties of learned representation: the ability of a model to transfer syntactic generalizations from a base context  to a transformed context . We test four models trained on the same dataset: an $n$-gram baseline, an LSTM, and two LSTM-variants trained with explicit structural supervision \citep{dyer2016rnng, charniak2016parsing}. We find that in most cases, the neural models are able to induce the proper syntactic generalizations after minimal exposure, often from just two examples during training, and that the two structurally supervised models generalize more accurately than the LSTM model. All neural models are able to leverage information learned in base contexts to drive expectations in transformed contexts, indicating that they have learned some invariance properties of syntax.\blfootnote{Miguel conducted this work while at IBM Research}"
"Despite \bert{'s} popularity effectiveness, little known inner workings. Several attempts made demystify certain aspects \bert , often leading contradicting conclusions. For instance, \citet{clark-etal-2019-bert} argue attention measures importance particular word computing next level representation word. However, \citet{kovaleva-etal-2019-revealing} showed attention heads contain trivial linguistic information follow vertical pattern , could related under-utilization over-parameterization issues. Other studies attempted link specific \bert heads linguistically interpretable functions , agreeing single head densely encodes enough relevant information instead different linguistic features learnt different attention heads. We hypothesize aforementioned largely contributes lack attention-based explainability \bert. Another open topic knowledge distributed across \bert layers. Most studies agree syntactic knowledge gathered middle layers , final layers task-specific. Most importantly, seems semantic knowledge spread across model, explaining non-trivial tasks better solved higher layers . Driven discussion, propose novel fine-tuning approach different parts \bert guided directly solve increasingly challenging classification tasks following underlying label hierarchy. Specifically, focus Large Scale Multilabel Text Classification documents assigned one labels large predefined set. The labels organized hierarchy general specific concepts. Our approach attempts tie specific \bert layers specific hierarchy levels. In effect, layers responsible predicting labels corresponding level. We experiment two \lmtc datasets several variations structured \bert training. Our contributions are: We propose novel structured approach fine-tune \bert specific layers tied specific hierarchy levels; We show structured training yields better results baseline across levels hierarchy, also leading better parameter utilization. In paper, tested few-shot learning capabilities neural language models, well whether models learn grammatical representations invariant syntactic transformation. First, addressed neural models' ability learn nominal number, introducing novel testing paradigm leveraged polar questions assess subject/verb number agreement learning syntactically transformed settings. Second, turned neural models' ability represent verbal argument structure, developing two novel suites tests assessed preference themes---either realized direct objects passive subjects---in active contexts passive contexts. In experiment assessed effect syntactic supervision learning outcomes comparing two supervised models one purely sequence model. A summary results seen Table, few-shot learning outcomes colored cells left, effect structural supervision right. The results experiments assess syntactic invariance bottom, line break. This table makes clear neural models capable making syntactic generalizations token minimal exposure training. Although model accuracy reduced tests assess syntactic invariance, neural models show least moderate ability generalize across syntactic transformations. Furthermore, Table shows syntactic invariance enhanced structurally supervised models. Interestingly, ActionLSTM RNNG access syntactic information, comparison Table indicates RNNG leverage information effectively produce syntactic invariance. Therefore suggest RNNG's improved performance come mere presence syntactic information training test data, rather fact uses syntactic information structure computation non-sequential way. Models performed better singular nouns transitive verbs, especially token occurred minimally training. This behavioral pattern consistent hypothesis outlined \citet{jumelet2019analysing}, suggest models acquire default syntactic categories, require supporting evidence make non-default predictions. Because experiments require careful robust syntactic analysis training data, evaluated models trained relatively small, human-annotated corpus. While small training data poses limitations interpreting results, makes relevant low-resource NLP applications suggests using structurally supervised models lead better generalization sparse data environment. While sub-word tokenization schemes Byte-Pair Encoding helped reduce number individual lexical items need learned, completely eliminate long tail sub-word units. Thus, robust few-shot generalization still important problem environments. It may larger amounts training data support even better few-shot learning syntactic invariance outcomes. Scaling carefully-controlled methods larger data setting important next step. However, even relatively small models tested here, results support growing body evidence incremental statistical models language able induce many key features human linguistic competence. \section*{Acknowledgements} The authors thank anonymous reviewers feedback.

Several attempts have been made to shed light on certain aspects of \bert, often with contradicting conclusions. A much raised concern focuses on \bert's over-parameterization and under-utilization issues. To this end, we propose o novel approach to fine-tune \bert in a structured manner. Specifically, we focus on Large Scale Multilabel Text Classification  where documents are assigned with one or more labels from a large predefined set of hierarchically organized labels. Our approach guides specific \bert layers to predict labels from specific hierarchy levels. Experimenting with two \lmtc datasets we show that this structured fine-tuning approach not only yields better classification results but also leads to better parameter utilization."

In work, present novel techniques enable successful offline reinforcement learning base language model real human conversations. This allows dialog systems practitioner train models learn language structure vast, readily-available corpora, fine-tune specific desirable behaviors post-hoc RL rewards. We observe new offline RL method successfully optimizes generated bot rewards elicited human responses. We show presents better option using regularization training specific bot behavior. Further, RL currently remains option maximizing user feedback course conversation. Compared prior work offline RL, novel WOP offline RL algorithm achieves higher performance traditional RL tasks, elicits positive feedback conversations novel humans test time, earns overall higher human ratings. A limitation study question optimize RL improve overall qualitative ratings remains open. We shown manual ratings sparse optimize effectively, instead suggest using implicit rewards. However, reward set proved insufficient achieve higher human quality ratings, least limited offline training data able collect. It unlikely rewards proposed fully cover means high quality open-ended conversation. Future work investigate rewards training open-domain dialog model long term conversation rewards may need computed many conversation turns. Our work computes conversational rewards based dialog data annotations online task workers United States. Considering broader impacts work, representative diverse set conversations annotations collected real world systems trained deployed using algorithms.

For many practical applications, may specific requirements language generated model---for example, appropriate, positive, polite---even leads lower perception conversation quality users. We shown Way Off-Policy algorithm provides effective way teach language model specific behaviors offline data previously proposed RL regularization techniques. \section*{Acknowledgments} We would like thank Scott Fujimoto insightful email correspondence topic, approval DBCQ algorithm, suggestion apply model averaging.

This consistent results VHRED model. \section{Traditional RL experiments} To demonstrate effectiveness techniques, tested traditional RL tasks using OpenAI gym , focusing CartPole-v0 Acrobot-v1 experiments. We first train online -learning Behavior policy, store experience samples replay buffer. We use buffer train prior model using Variational Auto-encoder. The VAE trained reconstruct next state given current state, , using mean-squared error loss. The next action predicted latent embedding , meaning model learned three functions: , , . For Cartpole, encoder decoder made two linear layers 750 neurons each. The latent dimension VAE size 256. For Acrobot, encoder decoder one layer size 256 each, latent dimension 64. This VAE used part DBCQ WOP algorithms. We also use imitation learning, sampling actions directly obtain Behavioral Cloning . We benchmark techniques vanilla -learning batch data . All -networks shared underlying architecture: three fully-connected layers size [256, 128, 64], ReLU activation between. All models trained Adam optimizer . For experiment, ran 50 trials model different random seed time. The Behavior policy trained total 20,000 steps environment, Full buffer condition offline agents saw 20,000 experience samples. The Behavior policy typically converged 10,000 steps, Expert demonstrator condition offline agents received last 10,000 experience samples trained agent. In Concurrent condition, offline agents saw moving window 1000 samples, since online learner used recent 1000 samples buffer learning. The learning rate .001, , decayed linearly 1.0 .01 2000 steps. The KL-constraint computed , . DBCQ sampled actions selecting best action based maximum -value; note environment 2 actions. For Cartpole used -learning loss, Acrobot used traditional -learning loss. We experiment four different conditions vary quality Behavior policy replay buffer data: a) Full buffer: experience samples experienced online training used offline learning; b) Concurrent: offline learning algorithms see sliding window experience samples order online learner experienced them; c) Expert demonstrator: buffer contains experience generated fully trained online learner; d) Noisy demonstrator: online learner high probability acting randomly thus bad model optimal policy. Figure shows results. Across conditions, see WOP able outperform Batch , imitation learning , DBCQ, original behavior policy. As expected, Imitation learning underperforms techniques batch contains noisy inexpert experience samples. However, batch contains expert trajectories, Batch fails learn, batch cover full state-action space well, increasing extrapolation error. DBCQ matches outperforms BC Batch scenarios. However, DBCQ acts sampling learned BC model, performance suffers batch data noisy imperfect. In contrast, WOP able learn trade-off staying close prior obtaining higher reward, consistently outperforms algorithms environment. \section{Additional results} Figure shows KL-divergence RL policies prior language model throughout offline RL training. Without KL-regularization, baseline RL models diverge quickly continuously prior, losing information realistic sequences. This figure also helps explain poor performance DBCQ Table . The underlying -network DBCQ directly integrate prior. As -learning causes model diverge prior, -estimates language generated according prior become unrealistic, selects unrealistic actions. This results highly `diverse' generated utterances. Note since operate discrete action space, could include perturbation model originally proposed , may critical achieving good performance BCQ. \section{Implicit Rewards Details} The total reward used train bots combination rewards described Table . These rewards selected based average z-score rewards utterances upvoted downvoted. Figure shows user rewards User Laughter User Sentiment reward scores correlate upvotes downvotes. Figure shows bot rewards Bot Sentiment, Bot Laughter, Bot Convo. Repetition, Bot Utterance Repetition rewards correlate manual votes. Figure shows bot-user combined rewards, Word Similarity USE Similarity rewards correlate manual downvotes. Based prior work , use number turns conversation indicator quality bot's performance. To distribute reward every utterance conversation, take total conversation length , compute discounted reward utterance . We also reward utterance number words characters user's response, refer User Ans. Word Len User Ans. Char Len. We also examine long bot responses Bot Response Length reward. Laughter shown important human affiliation solidarity . Therefore, detect number occurrences strings indicating laughter user's response, use reward. Interestingly, find bots trained maximize user laughter learn extremely supportive cheerful compared bots . Language style matching shown strong predictor relationship initiation stability . While would ideal chatbots could intelligently adapt conversation style new user, reality baseline dialog models struggle maintain topic coherence, even utterances . Therefore reward semantic similarity user's input bot's response, encourage bot stay topic produce reasonable answers. The Infersent Cornell Coherence Infersent Reddit Coherence rewards computed using sentence embedding model trained Reddit Cornell corpora respectively . We use Universal Sentence Encoder compute USE Similarity reward. We also directly compute word overlap reward Word Similarity. Asking questions important listening skill, linked conversation management, attentiveness, responsiveness . Therefore, give bot reward 0.5 utterance contains question word , additional 0.5 contains question mark. We refer reward Bot Question. After training bots rewards, noticed shift distribution language towards polite, cheerful, supportive speech. Therefore, designed post-hoc metrics measure qualities, based counting whether subset phrases present utterance. Compliment phrases: beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, best, best, like you, good, good, love way Politeness phrases: I may; may I; please; thanks; worries; mind; great day; I'm sorry. Supportive phrases: right; right; alone; alone; congrats; that's good idea; good idea; fine; fine; okay; okay; get better; sorry going through; sorry going through; makes feel better; makes feel better; keep head up; keep up; I'm similar situation; I similar situation; get it; get it; happy you; I'm boat; I boat; feel like need vent. Cheerful phrases: nice hear; happy; excited; really nice; glad; best; great; good time; looking forward; beautiful. We also want discourage bot malicious offensive language. \citet{saleh2019hierarchical} incorporate Toxicity Classifier trained data Toxic Comment Classification Challenge\footnote{} reward training hierarchical RL dialog models. We compute Toxicity reward scores using classifier Bot Toxicity . Specificity within conversation valuable avoid exchanging vacuous phrases back forth. However building chit-chat bot without knowledge graph back-end limits level substance incorporated conversation. We use approach computing normalize IDF create specificity conversation. We compute NIDF user bot text. While minimizing repetition common implicit goal dialog systems, explicitly optimize reducing repetition repetition rewards. We compute utterance repetition number non-unique words utterance Bot Utterance Repetition Reward. We compute conversation repetition number non-unique words conversation Bot Convo. Repetition Reward. These rewards negated since want higher reward score less repetition. We also remove stop words computation non-unique words. \section{Interactive bot platform details} To collect data humans interacting bots, built platform hosting deep neural network dialog models online GPU fast, real-time inference. Figure shows example interface, users able rate bots talking least three turns. Note chat, annotators optionally click arrows beside chatbot response give feedback specific utterance. Once 6 turns conversation taken place, participants may click ``Close Chat Rate"" get rating screen. We train RL models based chat data collected platform. Currently, conversations contain Personally Identifiable Information user name, age, location, etc. We obtained IRB approval study cannot release conversations time current form. The server hosted Google Cloud Platform virtual instance 64GB RAM NVIDIA Tesla P100 graphics card. The backend Django program served NGINX uWSGI. For simplicity, opted Django process import chatbots Python process Django, rather two connect via means sockets. This configuration decreased development time increased reliability, would need revisited server needed scale several orders magnitude past required study. The current configuration still able support hundreds simultaneous users host 30 bots concurrently. The chatbots kept separate project Django project maintained separately server code. Each chatbot extended abstract class defined key methods Django program use, registered globally accessible dictionary via decorator. The Django project provided path Chatbots project PYTHONPATH, could import dictionary chatbot objects registered use dynamically determine chatbots available access views.

To collect a large corpus of parallel data, heuristic rules are often used but they inevitably let noise into the data, such as phrases in the output which cannot be explained by the input.  Consequently, models pick up on the noise and may hallucinate--generate fluent but unsupported text.  Our contribution is a simple but powerful technique to treat such hallucinations as a controllable aspect of the generated text, without dismissing any input and without modifying the model architecture. On the WikiBio corpus \cite{lebret-etal-2016-neural}, a particularly noisy dataset, we demonstrate the efficacy of the technique both in an automatic and in a human evaluation."

The development of new commonsense knowledge graphs  has been central to these advances as their diverse facts can be used and referenced by machine learning models for tackling new and challenging tasks. At the same time, there remain questions about the quality and coverage of these resources due to the massive scale required to comprehensively encompass general commonsense knowledge.  In this work, we posit that manually constructed CSKGs will never achieve the coverage necessary to be applicable in all situations encountered by NLP agents. Therefore, we propose a new evaluation framework for testing the utility of KGs based on how effectively implicit knowledge representations can be learned from them.   With this new goal, we propose \atomicTT{}, a new CSKG of general-purpose commonsense knowledge containing knowledge that is not readily available in pretrained language models. We evaluate its properties in comparison with other leading CSKGs, performing the first large-scale pairwise study of commonsense knowledge resources. Next, we show that \atomicTT{} is better suited for training knowledge models that can generate accurate, representative knowledge for new, unseen entities and events. Finally, through human evaluation, we show that the few-shot performance of GPT-3 , while impressive, remains $\sim$12 absolute points lower than a BART-based knowledge model trained on \atomicTT{} despite using  over 430x fewer parameters.  % useful they are for training knowledge models that can generate relevant representative knowledge for new, unseen entities.  % In this work, we propose \atomicTT{}, a new knowledge graph of general-purpose commonsense knowledge facts. To evaluate its utility in comparison to existing resources, we perform the first large-scale pairwise study of commonsense knowledge graphs on coverage and precision. Finally, we posit that a new use for commonsense knowledge graphs is their ability to allow large-scale language models to learn to represent knowledge implicitly. We propose a new evaluation for testing knowledge graphs on how useful they are for training knowledge models that can generate relevant representative knowledge for new, unseen entities."
"Despite successes, neural machine translation still unresolved problems. Among problem rare words, paradoxically common Zipf's Law. In part, problem intrinsic data-driven machine translation system inevitably encounter words seen training data. In part, however, NMT systems seem particularly challenged rare words, compared older statistical models. One reason NMT systems fixed-size vocabulary, typically 10k--100k words; words outside vocabulary represented using special symbol like \unk{}. Byte pair encoding breaks rare words smaller, frequent subwords, least allowing NMT see instead \unk{} . But means solves problem; even subwords, NMT seems difficulty learning translations rare words, possibly instance catastrophic forgetting . Humans deal rare words looking dictionary, idea using dictionaries assist machine translation extremely old. From statistical perspective, dictionaries useful complement running text uniform distribution dictionary headwords smooth long-tailed distribution running text. In pre-neural statistical machine translation systems, typical way incorporate bilingual dictionaries simply include parallel sentences training data. But , work well NMT systems. We aware previous attempts find better ways incorporate bilingual dictionaries NMT. Some methods use dictionaries synthesize new training examples . \citet{arthur-etal-2016-incorporating} extend model encourage generate translations dictionary. \citet{post+vilar:naacl2018} constrain decoder generate translations dictionary. What approaches common treat dictionary definitions target-language text, when, fact, often properties different ordinary text. For example, CEDICT defines \zh{濮濄倛鍤 ``'' cannot used translation. In case monolingual source-language dictionary, definitions are, course, written target language all. In paper, present extension Transformer ``attaches'' dictionary definitions rare words occurrences source sentences. We introduce new position encodings represent nonlinear structure source sentence attachments. Then unmodified translation model learn make use attached information. We show additional information yields improvements translation accuracy 3.1 BLEU.

Despite conclusions prior work , results Table clear language models fail express large varieties knowledge prompted zero-shot manner. When converted \comet models training knowledge graph, performance hypothesizing knowledge tuples skyrockets -- 47.9\ absolute difference \cometbart{} \gptxl{} \atomicTT. However, evaluation tuples adversarially selected include head entities training set. The model must generalize learned representations relations entities observed relationships point fine-tuning, meaning representation entities solely formulated learning language. As result, language models may still encode knowledge parameters, even capable expressing directly. With framing mind, COMET training paradigm proposed \citet{Bosselut2019COMETCT} perhaps viewed less means learning knowledge KGs, method learning interface language models hypothesize encoded knowledge language generation. We look forward future work space attempts disentangle two ideas. What considerations made designing commonsense knowledge resources? Commonsense knowledge graphs uniquitous tools natural language processing agents must perform commonsense reasoning. Based results Section, outline desiderata design development future commonsense knowledge graphs. Because certain types knowledge already encoded expressible pretrained language models, CSKG designers focus collecting examples categories knowledge less likely known language models. For example, 378 test tuples evaluated \gptxl{} zero-shot model contained \HinderedBy{} relation, 1.3\ deemed plausible human raters -- jumping 85\ plausibility \cometbart{} -- pointing advantage constructing \atomicTT{} relationship mind . Second, commonsense knowledge resources designed goal accuracy relationship coverage. Because language models exhibit powerful adaptation , generalize many commonsense relationships long examples train. Consequently, construct commonsense resources encapsulate larger numbers relations knowledge pretrained language models grounded variety relationships. However, language models also benefit learning precise examples. Being able train large collection examples \transomcs allow \comet models generalize unseen entities examples sufficient quality . Resources carefully validated quality facts, example set \citet{speer2017conceptnet} \citet{sap2018atomic}. \section{Conclusion} In work, formalize use commonsense knowledge graphs transfer learning tools pretrained language models. With new purpose, hypothesize commonsense knowledge graphs designed contain knowledge already expressible language models without difficulty . Consequently, propose \atomicTT, novel commonsense knowledge graph containing tuples whose relations specifically selected challenging pretrained language models express. Our empirical studies demonstrate \atomicTT contains high-accuracy knowledge tuples across multiple novel relations found existing CSKGs expressible LMs. Furthermore, show \atomicTT effectively used training set adapting language models knowledge models generate high quality tuples on-demand. \clearpage"," Despite advances in neural machine translation  quality, rare words continue to be problematic.

In the zero-shot cross-lingual transfer setting, only English training data is assumed, and the fine-tuned model is evaluated on another target language.  No target-language validation data is assumed in this setting, however substantial variance has been observed in target language performance between different fine-tuning runs.  Prior work has relied on English validation/development data to select among models that are fine-tuned with different learning rates, number of steps and other hyperparameters, often resulting in suboptimal choices.  To address this challenge, we propose a meta-learning approach to model selection that uses the fine-tuned model's own internal representations to predict its cross-lingual capabilities.  In extensive experiments we find that our approach consistently selects better models than English validation data across five languages and five well-studied NLP tasks, achieving results that are comparable to small amounts of target language development data.\footnote{We will make our code and data available on publication.}  %We further demonstrate that our method can benefit from pooling data across tasks when auxiliary annotations are available in the target language."

So far, summarization researchers have given considerably more attention to relevance than to background knowledge. In contrast, this work puts background knowledge in the foreground. Building on the realization that the choices made by human summarizers and annotators contain implicit information about their background knowledge, we develop and compare techniques for inferring background knowledge from summarization data. Based on this framework, we define summary scoring functions that explicitly model background knowledge, and show that these scoring functions fit human judgments significantly better than baselines. We illustrate some of the many potential applications of our framework. First, we provide insights into human information importance priors. Second, we demonstrate that averaging the background knowledge of multiple, potentially biased annotators or corpora greatly improves summary\hyp scoring performance.

"Event extraction process extract named entities, event triggers relationships real-world corpora. The named entities refer texts predefined classes event triggers words express types events texts . In literature, named entities triggers connected named entities corresponding roles called arguments given trigger specific event. %Named entities refer text mentions predefined classes person names, company names locations, etc. An event trigger word mostly expresses event types text. Named entities link triggers different roles, named entities corresponding roles called arguments given trigger specific event. Currently, existing works divide event extraction two independent sub-tasks: named entity recognition trigger labeling. These two sub-tasks always formulated multi-class classification problems, many works apply sequence-to-sequence based labeling method aims translate sentence sequential tags. From investigation, one problem sequence-to-sequence methods ignore orders output tags, therefore, difficult precisely annotate different parts entity. To address issue, methods propose incorporate conditional random field module aware order-constraints annotated tags. Since entities triggers naturally connected around events, recent works try extract jointly corpora. Early methods apply pipeline frameworks predefined lexical features lack generality different applications. Recent works leverage structural dependency entities triggers improve performances entity trigger identification sub-tasks. %The prevalent methods divided two categories: a) parallel framework obtain entities triggers simultaneously b) pipeline framework get triggers first perform sub-tasks extract entities.

From figure, observe trigger necessarily connect entities directly direct-adjacency-based distribution concentrated entities, meta-path-based distribution spread larger number entities. This shows model could collect indirect co-occurrence patterns entities triggers based meta-path adjacency matrix ``entity-trigger'' HIN. Moreover, obtained indirect patterns could applied improve performance extract entities triggers. Based aforementioned example analysis, propose neural network extract event entities triggers. Our model built top sequence-to-sequence labeling framework inner parameters supervised ground-truth annotations sentences ``entity-trigger'' co-occurrence relationships. Furthermore, fully address indirect ``entity-trigger'' co-occurrence relationships, propose \underline{C}ross-\underline{S}upervised \underline{M}echanism based HIN. The CSM alternatively supervises entity trigger extraction indirect co-occurrence patterns mined corpus. CSM builds bridge triggers entities collecting latent co-occurrence patterns along meta-paths corresponding heterogeneous information network corpus. Then obtained patterns applied boost performances entity triggers extractions alternatively. We define process ``cross-supervise'' mechanism.

Most existing works do not fully address the sparse co-occurrence relationships between entities and triggers, which loses this important information and thus deteriorates the extraction performance. To mitigate this issue, we first define the joint-event-extraction as a sequence-to-sequence labeling task with a tag set composed of tags of triggers and entities. Then, to incorporate the missing information in the aforementioned co-occurrence relationships, we propose a \underline{C}ross-\underline{S}upervised \underline{M}echanism  to alternately supervise the extraction of either triggers or entities based on the type distribution of each other. Moreover, since the connected entities and triggers naturally form a heterogeneous information network , we leverage the latent pattern along meta-paths for a given corpus to further improve the performance of our proposed method. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets as well as compare our method with state-of-the-art methods. Empirical results and analysis show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both entity and trigger extraction."
"Recently, pre-trained self-supervised models BERT attracted increasing amount attention natural language processing vision-language processing.

Moreover, order enable model learn ``difficult'' ``diverse'' instances, two effective methods proposed enhance capability model extract noise-concentrated instance-diffused features. With training objective, pre-trained model encouraged learn noise invariant representations, thereby alleviating pretrain-finetune discrepancy extent. As additional benefit, CAPT also assists pre-trained model effectively capture global semantics input. Most prior work focuses token-level pre-training tasks , lacks modeling global semantics input. Some efforts alleviate problem introducing sentence-level pre-training tasks rely relative position segments document. However, semantic connection segments tends excessively loose, may result confusing gradient signals. By contrast, CAPT offers incentives representations inputs sharing semantics similar, representations inputs expressing different semantics penalized distinguished other. Such reasonable sentence-level supervision enables approach look beyond local structures input sequences become aware global semantics. %With reasonable sentence-level supervision, approach achieves better modeling global semantics input.

Our future works include: investigating impact length sampled meta-paths, paper limited meta-path fixed length; connecting extracted entities triggers corpus facilitate automatic knowledge graph construction."," Pre-trained self-supervised models such as BERT have achieved striking success in learning sequence representations, especially for natural language processing. These models typically corrupt the given sequences with certain types of noise, such as masking, shuffling, or substitution, and then try to recover the original input. However, such pre-training approaches are prone to learning representations that are covariant with the noise, leading to the discrepancy between the pre-training and fine-tuning stage. To remedy this, we present ContrAstive Pre-Training  to learn noise invariant sequence representations. The proposed CAPT encourages the consistency between representations of the original sequence and its corrupted version via unsupervised instance-wise training signals. In this way, it not only alleviates the pretrain-finetune discrepancy induced by the noise of pre-training, but also aids the pre-trained model in better capturing global semantics of the input via more effective sentence-level supervision. Different from most prior work that focuses on a particular modality, comprehensive empirical evidence on 11 natural language understanding and cross-modal tasks illustrates that CAPT is applicable for both language and vision-language tasks, and obtains surprisingly consistent improvement, including 0.6\% absolute gain on GLUE benchmarks and 0.8\% absolute increment on $\text{NLVR}^2$."

Here is a suggestion:}    Understanding natural language involves recognizing how multiple event mentions structurally and temporally interact with each other.     In this process, one can induce event complexes that organize multi-granular events with temporal order and membership relations interweaving among them.    Due to the lack of jointly labeled data for these relational phenomena and the restriction on the structures they articulate, we propose a joint constrained learning framework for modeling event-event relations.    Specifically, the framework enforces logical constraints within and across multiple temporal and subevent relations     %of events     by converting these constraints into differentiable learning objectives. We show that our joint constrained learning approach effectively compensates for the lack of jointly labeled data, and outperforms SOTA methods on benchmarks for both temporal relation extraction and event hierarchy construction, replacing a commonly used but more expensive global inference process.    We also present a promising case study showing the effectiveness of our approach in inducing event complexes on an external corpus.\footnote{Our code is publicly available at \url{https://cogcomp.seas.upenn.edu/page/publication_view/914}.} %\dr{Doesn't this contradict the statement above regarding the lack of joint data?

Nevertheless, most of the work in NLP has focused on predicate mentions and not on the event complex they form together.      In this paper we study the induction of larger event units from text -- identifying a set of predicate mentions that together -- via temporal, co-reference, and subevent relations, form event complexes.     The scarcity of jointly labeled data for these relational phenomena presents a significant technical challenge. However, these phenomena interact with each other, thus restricting the structures they articulate. To make this explicit, we propose a joint learning framework that enforces logical constraints among the relations to be identified, by converting these into differentiable learning objectives.      We show that not only does our joint training approach address the lack of jointly labeled data, but it also outperforms SOTA results on both the temporal benchmark data set and the event hierarchy benchmark data set. %We also present a promising case study on RED, a small-scale dataset with fully annotated relations.     }     \fi     \ignore{     We study within-document temporal and hierarchical relations of events using a joint constrained learning framework.      %We first obtain the event representation  via an encoder, and then jointly train a multi-layer perceptron to predict confidence scores for temporal and hierarchical relations before we make structured prediction via integer linear programming .      The framework first incorporates a contextualized encoder to characterize the events in the document, and then predicts the confidence scores for temporal and hierarchical relations among them.     In the training phase, our framework learns to enforce logic consistency among various types of event relations in both categories,     by converting declarative rules into differentiable learning objective functions. %Furthermore, the consistency of final prediction is enforced by global inference .      %The inference phase performs structured prediction based on integer linear programming  to respect the corresponding logic constraints of relations.     %We utilize the benchmark dataset for the extraction task of each category of relations for training and evaluation. %By experimental results, we prove the feasibility of joint constrained learning of different tasks using datasets that have partial annotations for each task, %avoiding the labor for creating another dataset that has full annotation.     The experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art method on the benchmark dataset, MATRES, of event temporal relation extraction task by 2.8\%; and it improves over the model of training jointly without constraints by 5\% F1-score on HiEve dataset, a benchmark for event hierarchy construction.     Therefore, the joint constrained learning effectively bridges the tasks with limited annotated learning resources, and promisingly leverages domain rules to support the precise learning and inference of various event relations.     }"

Sentence representation learning has been widely explored in recent years and it has been shown that it improves the generalization of different downstream tasks across many domains. Even though utilizing probing methods in several studies suggests that these learned contextual representations implicitly encode some amount of syntax, explicit syntactic information further improves the performance of deep neural models in the domain of authorship attribution. These observations have motivated us to investigate the explicit representation learning of syntactic structure of sentences.  In this paper, we propose a self-supervised framework for learning structural representations of sentences. The self-supervised network contains two components; a lexical sub-network and a syntactic sub-network which take the sequence of words and their corresponding structural labels as the input, respectively. Due to the $n$-to-$1$ mapping of words to their structural labels, each word will be embedded into a vector representation which mainly carries structural information. We evaluate the learned structural representations of sentences using different probing tasks, and subsequently utilize them in the authorship attribution task. Our experimental results indicate that the structural embeddings significantly improve the classification tasks when concatenated with the existing pre-trained word embeddings."

These advances raise the question of whether they can be extended to a point where we can relax the fundamental assumption of database management, namely, that our data is represented as fields of a pre-defined schema.   This paper presents a first step in answering that question.  We describe \ndb, a database system with no pre-defined schema, in which updates and queries are given in natural language. We develop query processing techniques that build on the  primitives offered by the state of the art Natural Language Processing methods.   We begin by demonstrating that at the core, recent NLP transformers, powered by pre-trained language models, can answer select-project-join queries if they are given the exact set of relevant facts. However, they cannot scale to non-trivial databases and cannot perform aggregation queries. Based on these findings, we describe a \ndb\ architecture that runs multiple Neural SPJ operators in parallel, each with a set of database sentences that can produce one of the answers to the query. The result of these operators is fed to an aggregation operator if needed. We describe an algorithm that learns how to create the appropriate sets of facts to be fed into each of the Neural SPJ operators. Importantly, this algorithm can be trained by the Neural SPJ operator itself. We experimentally validate the accuracy of \systemname\ and its components, showing that we can answer queries over thousands of sentences with very high accuracy."

A self-feeding chatbot improves itself by asking natural language feedback when a user is dissatisfied with its response and uses this feedback as an additional training sample.

In this work, we propose a generative adversarial model that converts noisy feedback into a plausible natural response in a conversation. The generator's goal is to convert the feedback into a response that answers the user's previous utterance and to fool the discriminator which distinguishes feedback from  natural responses.

For example, attach special token beginning source-side input sentence translation. The proposed Transum quite simple require additional architecture contrast effective cross-lingual abstractive summarization. Experimental results show Transum improves performance cross-lingual abstractive summarization outperforms previous methods Chinese-English Arabic-English summarization. In addition, Transum significantly improves machine translation performance compared obtained using genuine parallel corpus machine translation. Furthermore, construct new test set simulate realistic situations: cross-lingual summarization several length constraints. In summarization process, important generate summary desired length. However, existing test sets cross-lingual abstractive summarization cannot evaluate whether model controls output lengths test sets contain summaries multiple lengths. Thus, translate existing monolingual abstractive summarization contains summaries multiple lengths construct new test set. The contributions study follows: Our results suggest GPT-2 generally outputs better narratives recent non-GPT-based neural model. Additionally, find larger models better. While GPT-2 Large may infeasible long sequence generation, possible use GPT-2 Medium narrative lengths generated here. Once GPT-3 released public use, likely model outperform GPT-2 based trends. We encourage future work investigate similar hyperparameters see whether trends observed stable across model sizes. We recommend keeping hyperparameter within range . This aligns findings \citet{ippolito2020}, suggest values well needed generate text closely approximates human text. Diverse decoding increased narrative quality metrics small . This could used qualitatively induce intense vivid stories higher values, though finding seen preliminary tested domains. Using higher values also seemed induce vivid stories, less consistent fluency coherence; thus, diverse decoding objective could promising way increase narrative interestingness without significantly decreasing performance particular metric.

Surprisingly, find strong diversity-quality trade-off narrative generation, perhaps due creative long-form nature task. Indeed, diversity quality correlate well general: diverse decoding higher values often coincide better performance human metrics domain point. This could due creative long-form nature narrative generation compared tasks chatbot response generation. We thus encourage future work investigate methods inducing diverse output, certain methods increase human perceptions narrative quality. Our findings aim inform future efforts narrative generation domain establishing future baselines given recommended hyperparameters, facilitating investigation decoding objectives better narrative generation. Additionally, hope investigation highlights issues addressed future work evaluating narratives automatically, since metrics aside perplexity seem correlate well human judgments quality. \clearpage"," We present a multi-task learning framework for cross-lingual abstractive summarization to augment training data. Recent studies constructed pseudo cross-lingual abstractive summarization data to train their neural encoder-decoders. Meanwhile, we introduce existing genuine data such as translation pairs and monolingual abstractive summarization data into training. Our proposed method, Transum, attaches a special token to the beginning of the input sentence to indicate the target task. The special token enables us to incorporate the genuine data into the training data easily. The experimental results show that Transum achieves better performance than the model trained with only pseudo cross-lingual summarization data. In addition, we achieve the top ROUGE score on Chinese-English and Arabic-English abstractive summarization. Moreover, Transum also has a positive effect on machine translation. Experimental results indicate that Transum improves the performance from the strong baseline, Transformer, in Chinese-English, Arabic-English, and English-Japanese translation datasets."
"Table-to-text generation important task text generation structured data. It aims automatically producing descriptive natural language text covers salient information table help people get salient information tables. Practical applications found domains weather forecasts, biography generation, NBA news generation, etc. Over pass several years, neural text generation methods made significant progress task. \citeauthor{lebret-etal-2016-neural,wiseman-etal-2017-challenges,bao2018table} model machine translation task view input table record sequence. To generate text contains salient well-organized facts, \citeauthor{sha2018order,puduppully-etal-2019-data,moryossef-etal-2019-step,trisedya2020sentence,ijcai2020-522} explicitly model content selection planning. %Some works also introduce extra knowledge pre-executed symbolic operations table improve result. To learning better representation tables, \citeauthor{liu2018table,bao2018table,nema-etal-2018-generating,jain-etal-2018-mixed,gong-etal-2019-table} explicitly model structure table multiple levels different dimensions. In addition, \citeauthor{liu2019hierarchical} propose three auxiliary supervision tasks capture accurate semantic representation table. However, issues overlooked. First, many tables ) contain large number numerical records. For instance, records almost column types numeric ROTOWIR , benchmark NBA basketball games. Current methods treat records words natural language text ignore characteristics number play important role table representation, size attribute. In addition, noises human-written summaries dataset. These noises include redundant information records exist input tables ). These noises may cause incorrect alignments input tables target text wrong supervision signals. And affect performance models based content selection planning auxiliary supervision. %In addition, human writing summary describe given table, may consider salient records. For example, describing table Figure , may pay attention K. Leonard, top scorer. To solve problems, explore use information contained tables introduce two self-supervised tasks learn better representation tables. We argue better representation tables help model capture organize important facts, even without explicitly modeling content selection planning. Specially, improve ~\citeauthor{gong-etal-2019-table}'s method employ hierarchical table encoder model table structure record level row level. The record-level encoder utilizes two cascaded self-attention models encode table column row dimension, respectively. And then, introduce row-level fusion gate obtain row-level representation row. To learn number-aware record representation, introduce Number Ordering task. This task utilizes pointer network generate descending record sequence column table, according content. Figure shows number ordering example column PTS. To best knowledge, first work neural table-to-text generation via focusing learning representation number table. Another self-supervised task, Significance Ordering , proposed learn significance-aware representation record. The significance denotes relative relation records row. This inspired intuition humans describe performance player, tend focus salient records. For example, Figure , K. Thompson's scores likely described other's records. The SO task executes descending sort operation row according significance scores records. We use position index record measure importance smaller significance score, important record is. The position index record obtained results Number Ordering. For example, Figure , K. Thompson scores points largest PTS, significance score record 1. The proposed two tasks trained together table2text generation model share encoder parameters. Obviously, two proposed tasks self-supervised training labels easily obtained input tables. Therefore, errors caused noises training set avoided. %For record row, includes another size information:significance. It denotes relative relation records row. To learn significance-aware representation table, propose Significance Ordering task executes ascending sort operation row according significance records. We use position index record measure importance smaller significance score, important record is. The position index record obtained results Number Ordering. For example, Figure , K. Leonard score 45 points largest PTS, significance score record 1). Obviously, two proposed tasks self-supervised training labels easily obtained input tables. Therefore, errors caused noise training set avoided. We conducted experiments ROTOWIRE verify effectiveness proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate that, even without explicitly modeling content selection introducing extra knowledge, method help generate text contains salient well-organized facts.

We achieved top ROUGE scores Chinese-English Arabic-English abstractive summarization. Moreover, Transum also improved performance machine translation outperformed previous top score JIJI English-Japanese translation."," Table-to-text generation aims at automatically generating natural text to help people to conveniently obtain the important information in tables. Although neural models for table-to-text have achieved remarkable progress, some problems still overlooked. The first is that the values recorded in many tables are mostly numbers in practice. The existing approaches do not do special treatment for these, and still regard these as words in natural language text.  Secondly, the target texts in training dataset may contain redundant information or facts do not exist in the input tables. These may give wrong supervision signals to some methods based on content selection and planning and auxiliary supervision. To solve these problems, we propose two self-supervised tasks, Number Ordering and Significance Ordering,  to help to learn better table representation. The former works on the column dimension to help to incorporate the size property of numbers into table representation. The latter acts on row dimension and help to learn a significance-aware table representation. We test our methods on the widely used dataset ROTOWIRE which consists of NBA game statistic and related news. The experimental results demonstrate that the model trained together with these two self-supervised tasks can generate text that contains more salient and well-organized facts, even without modeling context selection and planning.

The gold standard in clinical data capturing is achieved via ``expert-review"", where clinicians can have a dialogue with a domain expert  and ask them questions about data entry rules. Automatically identifying ``real questions"" in these dialogues could uncover ambiguities or common problems in data capturing in a given clinical setting.  In this study, we proposed a novel multi-channel deep convolutional neural network architecture, namely Quest-CNN, for the purpose of separating real questions that expect  an answer  about an issue from sentences that are not questions, as well as from questions referring to an issue mentioned in a nearby sentence , which we will refer as ``c-questions"". We conducted a comprehensive performance comparison analysis of the proposed multi-channel deep convolutional neural network against other deep  neural networks. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of traditional rule-based and learning-based methods for detecting question sentences. The proposed Quest-CNN achieved the best F1 score both on a dataset of data entry-review dialogue in a dialysis care setting, and on a general domain dataset."

In this work, we adopt a data-driven methodology to unpack decoder behavior in both a blackbox and whitebox way. We fine-tune and analyze a GPT-2 \cite{radford-2019-gpt2} model on two benchmark datasets featuring different levels of abstraction. Our experiments yield three key results. First, by analyzing the entropy of model predictions and its corresponding test-time behavior, we find a strong correlation between low entropy and where the model copies document spans rather than generating novel text. Second, this entropy analysis can allow us to understand what sentence positions and even what syntactic configurations are associated with copying existing content. Finally, by analyzing decoder self-attention patterns, we can trace this copying behavior to a particular pattern of attending to immediate decoder context and finding the next token to generate in the source document. An advantage of seq2seq abstractive summarization models is that they generate text in a free-form manner, but this flexibility makes it difficult to interpret model behavior.  In this work, we analyze summarization decoders in both blackbox and whitebox ways by studying on the entropy, or uncertainty, of the model's token-level predictions. For two strong pre-trained models, PEGASUS \cite{pegasus} and BART \cite{lewis-2019-bart} on two summarization datasets, we find a strong correlation between low prediction entropy and where the model copies tokens rather than generating novel text. The decoder's uncertainty also connects to factors like sentence position and syntactic distance between adjacent pairs of tokens, giving a sense of what factors make a context particularly selective for the model's next output token. Finally, we study the relationship of decoder uncertainty and attention behavior to understand how attention gives rise to these observed effects in the model. We show that uncertainty is a useful perspective for analyzing summarization and text generation models more broadly.\footnote{Code is available at \url{https://github.com/jiacheng-xu/text-sum-uncertainty}} % can trace this copying behavior to a particular pattern of attending to immediate decoder context and finding the next token to generate in the source document."
"Neural attention mechanisms widely applied computer vision shown enable neural networks focus aspects input important given task. While neural networks able learn meaningful attention mechanisms using supervision received target task, addition human gaze information shown beneficial many cases. An especially interesting way leveraging gaze information demonstrated works incorporating human gaze neural attention mechanisms, example image video captioning visual question answering. While attention least important reading text viewing images, integration human gaze neural attention mechanisms natural language processing tasks remains under-explored. A major obstacle studying integration data scarcity: Existing corpora human gaze reading consist samples provide effective supervision modern data-intensive architectures human gaze data available small number NLP tasks. For paraphrase generation sentence compression, play important role tasks reading comprehension systems, human gaze data available. We address data scarcity two novel ways: First, overcome low number human gaze samples reading, propose novel hybrid text saliency model combine cognitive model reading behavior human gaze supervision single machine learning framework.

We propose a novel hybrid text saliency model  that, for the first time, combines a cognitive model of reading with explicit human gaze supervision in a single machine learning framework. On four different corpora we demonstrate that our hybrid TSM duration predictions are highly correlated with human gaze ground truth. We further propose a novel joint modeling approach to integrate TSM predictions into the attention layer of a network designed for a specific upstream NLP task without the need for any task-specific human gaze data. We demonstrate that our joint model outperforms the state of the art in paraphrase generation on the Quora Question Pairs corpus by more than 10\% in BLEU-4 and achieves state of the art performance for sentence compression on the challenging Google Sentence Compression corpus.

"In recent years, abstractive summarization made impressive progress development sequence-to-sequence framework . This framework composed encoder decoder. The encoder processes source text extracts necessary information decoder, predicts word summary. Thanks generative nature, abstractive summaries include novel expressions never seen source text, time, abstractive summaries difficult produce compared extractive summaries formed directly selecting subset source text. It also found seq2seq-based abstractive methods usually struggle generate out-of-vocabulary words rare words, even words found source text. Copy mechanism alleviate problem meanwhile maintain expressive power seq2seq framework. The idea allow decoder generate summary scratch also copy words source text. Though effective English text summarization, copy mechanism remains relatively undeveloped summarization East Asian languages e.g. Chinese. Generally speaking, abstractive methods Chinese text summarization comes two varieties, word-based character-based. Since explicit delimiter Chinese sentence indicate word boundary, first step word-based methods perform word segmentation . Actually, order avoid segmentation error reduce size vocabulary, existing methods character-based . When trying combine character-based methods Chinese copy mechanism, original ``word copy'' degrades ``character copy'' guarantee multi-character word copied verbatim source text . Unfortunately, copying multi-character words quite common Chinese summarization tasks. Take Large Scale Chinese Social Media Text Summarization Dataset example, according Table I, 37\% words summaries copied source texts consist multiple characters. } \end{center} \end{table} Selective read proposed handle problem. It calculates weighted sum encoder states corresponding last generated character adds result input next decoding step. Selective read provide location information source text decoder help perform consecutive copy. A disadvantage approach, however, increases reliance present computation partial results current step makes model vulnerable errors accumulation leads exposure bias inference. Another way make copied content consecutive directly copying text spans. Zhou et al. implement span copy operation equipping decoder module predicts start end positions span. Because longer span decomposed shorter ones, actually many different paths generate summary inference, model optimized longest common span time step training, exacerbates discrepancy two phases. In work, propose novel lexicon-constrained copying network . The decoder LCN copy either single character text span time, constrain text span match potential multi-character word. Specifically, given text several off-the-shell word segmentators, text span included segmentation result text, consider potential word. By so, number available spans significantly reduced, making viable marginalize possible paths training. Furthermore, inference, aggregate partial paths fly producing output using word-enhanced beam search algorithm, encourages model copy multi-character words facilitates parallel computation. To line aforementioned decoder, encoder revised learn representations characters also multi-character words. In context neural machine translation, Su et al. first organized characters multi-character words directed graph named word-lattice. Following Xiao et al. , adopt encoder based Transformer take word-lattice input allow character word hidden representation. By taking account relative positional information calculating self-attention, encoder capture global local dependencies among tokens, providing informative representation source text decoder make copy decisions. Although model character-based , directly utilize word-level prior knowledge, keywords. In setting, keywords refer words source text high probability inclusion summary. Inspired Gehrmann et al. , adopt separate word selector based large pre-trained language model, e.g. BERT extract keywords. When decoder intends copy words source text, selected keywords treated candidates, words masked out. Experimental results show model achieve better performance incorporating word selector. We propose general framework guided neural summarization, using investigate four types guidance signals achieve state-of-the-art performance various popular datasets. We demonstrate complementarity four guidance signals, find models generate novel words faithful summaries. We also show control output providing user-specified guidance signals. Given generality framework, opens possibility several future research directions including 1) developing strategies ensemble models different guidance signals; 2) incorporating sophisticated techniques copy coverage source document, guidance signal, both; 3) experimenting kinds guidance signals salient elementary discourse units."," Copy mechanism allows sequence-to-sequence models to choose words from the input and put them directly into the output, which is finding increasing use in abstractive summarization. However, since there is no explicit delimiter in Chinese sentences, most existing models for Chinese abstractive summarization can only perform character copy, resulting in inefficient. To solve this problem, we propose a lexicon-constrained copying network that models multi-granularity in both encoder and decoder. On the source side, words and characters are aggregated into the same input memory using a Transformer-based encoder. On the target side, the decoder can copy either a character or a multi-character word at each time step, and the decoding process is guided by a word-enhanced search algorithm which facilitates the parallel computation and encourages the model to copy more words. Moreover, we adopt a word selector to integrate keyword information. Experiments results on a Chinese social media dataset show that our model can work standalone or with the word selector. Both forms can outperform previous character-based models and achieve competitive performances."
"Humans supervised natural language inference . Supervision necessary applications human-defined domains. For example, humans need supervision noun POS tagging, tiger Wordnet classify image tiger ImageNet. However, NLI, people able entail \textcircled{a} A man plays piano contradicts \textcircled{b} A man plays clarinet family without supervision NLI labels. In paper, define inference general process establishing associations inferences texts, rather strictly classifying whether two sentences entail contradict other. Inspired this, raise core problem paper: Given pair natural language sentences, machines entail relationship without supervision inference labels? In highly acclaimed paper, neuroscientist Moshe Bar claims ``predictions rely existing scripts memory, result real well previously imagined experiences''. The exemplar theory argues humans use {\bf similarity} recognize different objects make decisions. Analogy helps humans understand novel object linking similar representation existing memory. Such linking facilitated object context. Context information widely applied self-supervision learning . Adapting context NLI even straightforward. A simple idea {\bf constant conjunction} A causes B constantly conjoined. Although constant conjunction contradicts ``correlation causation'', modern neuroscience confirmed humans use reasoning mental world. For example, found increase synaptic efficacy arises presynaptic cell's repeated persistent stimulation postsynaptic cell Hebbian theory. As natural language, object context naturally used determine inference. For example, \textcircled{a} contradicts \textcircled{b} cannot happen simultaneously {\bf context}. The context representation learned SSL already achieved big success NLP. From perspective context, models learn sentence level contextual information word level contextual information . Besides linguistic contexts, humans also link modalities novel inputs. Even goal reason plain texts, modalities still help . For example, textual information used, difficult entail contradiction \textcircled{a} \textcircled{b}. We need commonsense man two arms, cannot play piano clarinet simultaneously. This commonsense hard obtain text. However, link sentences visual scenes, contradiction much clearer two scenes cannot happen visual context. We think necessary incorporate modalities unsupervised natural language inference. The idea adapting multimodal SSL new. According to, briefly divide previous multimodal SSL approaches two categories based encoder infrastructures. As shown Fig., first category uses one joint encoder represent multimodal inputs. Obviously, downstream task plain text, cannot extract representation text separately joint encoder. So first category infeasible natural language inference. The second category first encodes text image separately two encoders. Then represents multimodal information via joint encoder lower layer encoders. This shown Fig.. Although textual representation extracted text encoder lower layer, representation go joint learning module contains little visual knowledge. In summary, encoders previous multimodal SSL approaches coupled. If textual inputs given, cannot effectively incorporate visual knowledge representations. Thus help entailing contradiction \textcircled{a} \textcircled{b} limited. In order benefit multimodal data plain text inference, propose \underline{M}ultimodal \underline{A}ligned \underline{C}ontrastive \underline{D}ecoupled learning network. This shown Fig.. Its text encoder decoupled, takes plain text inputs. Thus directly adapted downstream NLI tasks. Besides, use multimodal contrastive loss text encoder image encoder, thereby forcing text representation align corresponding image. Therefore even text encoder MACD takes plain text input, still represents visual knowledge. In downstream plain text inference tasks, without taking images input, text encoder MACD still implicitly incorporating visual knowledge learned multimodal contrastive loss. Note need decoupled image encoder SSL. So image encoder Fig. MACD takes texts inputs provides precise image encoder. We elaborate section. In paper, propose novel lexicon-constrained copying network Chinese summarization. Querying multigranularity representation learned encoder, decoder copy either character multi-character word time step. Experiments LCSTS dataset show model superior Transformer baselines quite competitive latest models. With help keyword information provide word selector, even achieve state-of-the-art performance.

In this paper, we propose \underline{M}ultimodal \underline{A}ligned \underline{C}ontrastive \underline{D}ecoupled learning  network. MACD forces the decoupled text encoder to represent the visual information via contrastive learning. Therefore, it embeds visual knowledge even for plain text inference.

Inspired by the recent success of the BERT model, we propose several modifications to BERT to enhance the performance on the downstream hatespeech classification task. {HABERTOR} inherits BERT's architecture, but is different in four aspects:  it generates its own vocabularies and is pre-trained from the scratch using the largest scale hatespeech dataset;  it consists of Quaternion-based factorized components, resulting in a much smaller number of parameters, faster training and inferencing, as well as less memory usage;  it uses our proposed multi-source ensemble heads with a pooling layer for separate input sources, to further enhance its effectiveness; and  it uses a regularized adversarial training with our proposed fine-grained and adaptive noise magnitude to enhance its robustness. Through experiments on the large-scale real-world hatespeech dataset with 1.4M annotated comments, we show that {HABERTOR} works better than 15 state-of-the-art hatespeech detection methods, including fine-tuning Language Models. In particular, comparing with BERT, our {HABERTOR} is 4$\sim$5 times faster in the training/inferencing phase, uses less than 1/3 of the memory, and has better performance, even though we pre-train it by using less than 1\% of the number of words. Our generalizability analysis shows that {HABERTOR} transfers well to other unseen hatespeech datasets and is a more efficient and effective alternative to BERT for the hatespeech classification.  %The code and the pretrained models are available at anonymized."

A lot of previous works formulate the problem as a question-answering  task.  While the collections of articles from web corpus provide updated information about the emerging entities, the retrieved texts can be noisy, irrelevant, thus leading to inaccurate answers. Effectively filtering out noisy articles as well as bad answers is the key to improving extraction accuracy. Knowledge graph , which contains rich, well organized information about entities, provides a good resource to address the challenge. In this work, we propose a knowledge-guided reinforcement learning  framework for open attribute value extraction.  Informed by relevant knowledge in KG, we trained a deep Q-network  to sequentially compare extracted answers to improve extraction accuracy. The proposed framework is applicable to different information extraction system. Our experimental results show that our method outperforms the baselines by 16.5 - 27.8\%."

Despite the huge success of neural pre-training methods in NLP tasks, its potential for temporal reasoning over event graphs has not been sufficiently explored. Part of the reason is the difficulty in obtaining large training corpora with human-annotated events and temporal links. We address this challenge by using existing IE/NLP tools to automatically generate a large quantity  of system-produced document-graph pairs, and propose a novel formulation of the contextualized graph generation problem as a sequence-to-sequence mapping task. These strategies enable us to leverage and fine-tune pre-trained language models on the system-induced training data for the graph generation task. Our experiments show that our approach is highly effective in generating structurally and semantically valid graphs. Further, evaluation on a challenging hand-labeled, out-domain corpus shows that our method outperforms the closest existing method by a large margin on several metrics.\footnote{Code and pre-trained models available at}"

"Machine Translation shown impressive progress recent years. Neural architectures greatly contributed improvement, especially languages abundant training data. This progress creates novel challenges evaluation machine translation, human automated evaluation protocols. Both types evaluation play important role machine translation. While human evaluations provide gold standard evaluation, involve fair amount careful hence expensive work human assessors. Cost therefore limits scale application. On hand, automated evaluations much less expensive. They typically involve human labor collecting human reference translations hence run scale compare wide range systems validate design decisions. The value automatic evaluations therefore resides capacity used proxy human evaluations large scale comparisons system development. The recent progress MT raised concerns whether automated evaluation methodologies reliably reflect human ratings high accuracy ranges. In particular, observed best systems according humans might fare less well automated metrics. Most metrics \BLEU TER measure overlap system output human reference translation. More refined ways compute overlap consequently proposed. Orthogonal work building improved metrics, hypothesized human references also important factor reliability automated evaluations. In particular, observed standard references exhibit simple, monotonic language due human `translationese` effects. These standard references might favor systems excel reproducing effects, independent underlying translation quality. They showed better correlation human automated evaluations could obtained replacing standard references paraphrased references, even still using surface overlap metrics BLEU~. The novel references, collected asking linguists paraphrase standard references, shown steer evaluation away rewarding translation artifacts. This improves assessment alternative, equally good translations. Our work builds success paraphrased translations evaluating existing systems, asks different design choices could made designing system evaluation protocol mind. This examination several potential benefits: help identify choices improve BLEU standard references limited impact final human evaluations; result better translations human reader, worse terms standard reference BLEU. Conversely, might turn paraphrased references robust enough support system development due presence `metric honeypots': settings produce poor translations, nevertheless assigned high BLEU scores.

When used in place of original references, the paraphrased versions produce metric scores that correlate better with human judgment. This effect holds for a variety of different automatic metrics, and tends to favor natural formulations over more literal  ones. In this paper we compare the results of performing end-to-end system development using standard and paraphrased references. With state-of-the-art English-German NMT components, we show that tuning to paraphrased references produces a system that is significantly better according to human judgment, but 5 BLEU points worse when tested on standard references. Our work confirms the finding that paraphrased references yield metric scores that correlate better with human judgment, and demonstrates for the first time that using these scores for system development can lead to significant improvements."

Extracting structured data from HTML documents is a long-studied problem with a broad range of applications like augmenting knowledge bases, supporting faceted search, and providing domain-specific experiences for key verticals like shopping and movies. Previous approaches have either required a small number of examples for each target site or relied on carefully handcrafted heuristics built over visual renderings of websites. In this paper, we present a novel two-stage neural approach, named FreeDOM, which overcomes both these limitations.  The first stage learns a representation for each DOM node in the page by combining both the text and markup information. The second stage captures longer range distance  and semantic relatedness using a relational neural network. By combining these stages, FreeDOM is able to generalize to unseen sites after training on a small number of seed sites from that vertical without requiring expensive hand-crafted features over visual renderings of the page. Through experiments on a public dataset with 8 different verticals, we show that FreeDOM beats the previous state of the art by nearly 3.7 F1 points on average without requiring features over rendered pages or expensive hand-crafted features. % 3.7 is from Table 2 k=3 .  % tata: Previous version of abstract follows:  %"

Due to the fact that some relations usually keep high co-occurrence in the same context, previous few-shot relation classifiers struggle to distinguish them with few annotated instances. To alleviate the above relation confusion problem, we propose CTEG, a model equipped with two mechanisms to learn to decouple these easily-confused relations. On the one hand, an Entity-Guided Attention  mechanism, which leverages the syntactic relations and relative positions between each word and the specified entity pair, is introduced to guide the attention to filter out information causing confusion. On the other hand, a Confusion-Aware Training  method is proposed to explicitly learn to distinguish relations by playing a pushing-away game between classifying a sentence into a true relation and its confusing relation. Extensive experiments are conducted on the FewRel dataset, and the results show that our proposed model achieves comparable and even much better results to strong baselines in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, the ablation test and case study verify the effectiveness of our proposed EGA and CAT, especially in addressing the relation confusion problem."

Nonetheless, hybrid models limited three disadvantages. First, since ground-truth labels extractive summarization usually provided, extractive labels must generated potentially suboptimal algorithm . The performance models trained labels therefore bounded quality performance extractive heuristics. Second, since ground-truth binary labels recurrently extracted sentences typically teacher forced \citet{chen-bansal-2018-fast}, ``exposure bias'' may negatively affect content selection performance inference. Finally, given hard extraction step differentiable, existing hybrid models typically require multi-step training reinforcement learning train whole model.

Most importantly, the memory compression step performs implicit extraction without labels, sidestepping issues with suboptimal ground-truth data and exposure bias of hybrid extractive-abstractive summarization techniques. By allowing the decoder to read/write over the encoded input memory, the model learns to read salient information about the input article while keeping track of what has been generated.  Our Mem2Mem approach yields results that are competitive with state of the art transformer based summarization methods, but with 16 times fewer parameters. %On abstractive long text summarization, Mem2Mem surpasses, with full end-to-end training, the current state-of-the-art by 3.98 and 3.08 average ROUGE scores on the Pubmed and arXiv datasets while using $16$ times less parameters.  % Our code and trained models are available at \url{https://github.com/anonymously999/mem2mem}."

Our experiments show proposed joint training systems effectively reduce word error rate ASR task 10\% 15\% improve BLEU score 3.69.2 ST tasks. %Compared previous methods, method emphasizes reducing difference two encoders eases knowledge transfer text text speech text tasks. %The method includes three parts: first, representation difference text speech input minimized phoneme sequence representation additional speech end sentence token.

Experiments conducted two popular ASR ST benchmark tasks. The results show proposed method brings substantial gains baseline ASR ST tasks. This work proposes Mem2Mem, novel MAED based mechanism long text abstractive summarization. Mem2Mem involves two memory types: A static encoder memory compressing input texts dynamic decoder memory refines generation process. Memory transfer links two memories maximizes benefit content extraction aimed summarization. Different existing hybrid extractive abstractive approaches, Mem2Mem incorporates extraction step without ground truth sentence labels multi-step training.

The Mem2Mem's memory compression generalized domains require text generation guided content selection. In future work, extend validate strength approach variety language learning tasks."," Attention-based sequence-to-sequence modeling provides a powerful and elegant solution for applications that need to map one sequence to a different sequence.  Its success heavily relies on the availability of large amounts of training data.  This presents a challenge for speech applications where labelled speech data is very expensive to obtain, such as automatic speech recognition  and speech translation .  In this study, we propose a general multi-task learning framework to leverage text data for ASR and ST tasks. Two auxiliary tasks, a denoising autoencoder task and machine translation task, are proposed to be co-trained with ASR and ST tasks respectively.  We demonstrate that representing text input as phoneme sequences can reduce the difference between speech and text inputs, and enhance the knowledge transfer from text corpora to the speech to text tasks.  Our experiments show that the proposed method achieves a relative 10$\sim$15\% word error rate reduction on the English Librispeech task compared with our baseline, and improves the speech translation quality on the MuST-C tasks by 3.6$\sim$9.2 BLEU."
"Motivated process human inquiry learning, field question generation requires model generate natural language questions context. QG wide applicability automated dialog systems, language assessment, data augmentation, development annotated data sets question answering research. Most prior research QG focused generating relatively simple factoid-based questions, answering question simply requires extracting span text single reference document. However, motivated desire build NLP systems capable sophisticated forms reasoning understanding, increasing interest developing systems multi-hop question answering generation , answering questions requires reasoning content multiple text documents . Unlike standard QG, generating multi-hop questions requires model understand relationship disjoint pieces information multiple context documents. Compared standard QG, multi-hop questions tend substantially longer, contain higher density named entities, and---perhaps importantly---high-quality multi-hop questions involve complex chains predicates connecting mentioned entities To address challenges, existing research multi-hop QG primarily relies graph-to-sequence methods. These approaches extract graph inputs augmenting original text structural information apply graph neural networks learn graph embeddings fed sequence-based decoder. However, necessity complex G2S approaches---which require designing hand-crafted graph extractors---is entirely clear, especially standard transformer-based sequence-to-sequence models already induce strong relational inductive bias. Since transformers inherent ability reason relationships entities text, one might imagine models alone would suffice relational reasoning requirements multi-hop QG. \xhdr{Present work} In work, show that, fact, standard transformer architecture sufficient outperform prior state-of-the-art multi-hop QG. We also propose analyze graph-augmented transformer ---which integrates explicit graph structure information transformer model.

However, show gains induced graph augmentations relatively small compared improvements vanilla transformer architecture, auxiliary contrastive objective data filtering approach, improve model 7.9 BLEU points ablation studies. Overall, results suggest diminishing returns incorporating hand-crafted graph structures multi-hop reasoning provides foundation stronger multi-hop reasoning systems based transformer architectures.

However, there is an increasing interest in developing systems that are capable of more complex multi-hop question generation, where answering the questions requires reasoning over multiple documents. In this work, we introduce a series of strong transformer models for multi-hop question generation, including a graph-augmented transformer that leverages relations between entities in the text.  While prior work has emphasized the importance of graph-based models, we show that we can substantially outperform the state-of-the-art by {5 BLEU points}  using a standard transformer architecture. We further demonstrate that graph-based augmentations can provide complimentary improvements on top of this foundation. Interestingly, we find that several important factors---such as the inclusion of an auxiliary contrastive objective and data filtering could have larger impacts on performance.

"\subsection{Dialogue act recognition} Mutual understanding interactive situations, either several people engaged dialogue interacting modern computer system natural language, may achieved without considering semantic information speakers utterances pragmatic interaction level, especially relative dialogue acts. Dialogue Acts represent meaning utterance context dialogue, or, words, function utterance dialogue. For example, function a~question request information, answer shall provide information. Dialogue acts thus commonly represented phrase-level labels statements, yes-no questions, open questions, acknowledgements, on. Automatic recognition dialogue acts fundamental component many human-machine interacting systems support natural language inputs. For instance, dialogue acts typically used input dialogue manager help deciding next action system: giving information user asking question, eventually keeping quiet user acknowledging, giving comment, even asking delaying interaction. In latter case, system reaction may perceived intrusive.

The majority works exploit supervised learning lexical, syntactic, prosodic and/or dialogue history features. However, approaches consider semantic features, may bring additional information prove useful improve accuracy dialogue act recognition system. For instance, a~frequent cause recognition errors ``unknown'' words testing corpus never occur training sentences. Replacing specific named entities text category proposed literature remedy issue. We investigate general solution exploits lexical similarity word vectors. These word vectors may computed various ways, typically include mostly lexical semantic information word well syntactic information, e.g., related relative position degree proximity pairs words within sentence. This additional information may used improve dialogue act recognition, particular training test conditions differ, size training corpus relatively small. %goal In work, propose new Deep Neural Network based Long Short-Term Memory task dialogue act recognition, compare performance standard Maximum Entropy model. Our first objective leverage modelling capacity DNN order achieve dialogue act recognition raw observed word forms, i.e., without additional expert-designed feature. This model described Section. The second objective validate model standard English DA corpus, well two languages, without changing anything model, order assess genericity robustness approach. These experiments summarized Section. Finally, third objective study impact word embeddings, shown provide extremely valuable information numerous Natural Language Processing tasks, never used far~\footnote{To best knowledge time submission} dialogue act recognition.

We discussed model capability consistently disentangle opinion-bearing topics plot/neutral ones measuring introduced disentangling rate. Finally, identified current limitations viable solutions explored future."," Dialogue act recognition is an important component of a large number of natural language processing pipelines. Many research works have been carried out in this area, but relatively few investigate deep neural networks and word embeddings. This is surprising, given that both of these techniques have proven exceptionally good in most other language-related domains. We propose in this work a new deep neural network that explores recurrent models to capture word sequences within sentences, and further study the impact of pretrained word embeddings. We validate this model on three languages: English, French and Czech. The performance of the proposed approach is consistent across these languages and it is comparable to the state-of-the-art results in English. More importantly, we confirm that deep neural networks indeed outperform a Maximum Entropy classifier, which was expected. However, and this is more surprising, we also found that standard word2vec embeddings do not seem to bring valuable information for this task and the proposed model, whatever the size of the training corpus is. We thus further analyse the resulting embeddings and conclude that a possible explanation may be related to the mismatch between the type of lexical-semantic information captured by the word2vec embeddings, and the kind of relations between words that is the most useful for the dialogue act recognition task."

Because only a few domains  have such document-level parallel data, we cannot perform accurate context-aware translation in most domains. We therefore present a simple method to turn a sentence-level translation model into a context-aware model by incorporating a document-level language model into the decoder. Our context-aware decoder is built upon only a sentence-level parallel corpora and monolingual corpora; thus no document-level parallel data is needed. In a theoretical viewpoint, the core part of this work is the novel representation of contextual information using point-wise mutual information between context and the current sentence. We show the effectiveness of our approach in three language pairs, English to French, English to Russian, and Japanese to English, by evaluation in bleu and contrastive tests for context-aware translation."

Keyphrase extraction task aims generate appropriate keyphrase set given document, thus helping identify salient contents concepts document. Recently, KE task attracted much research interest since serves important component many downstream applications text summarization, document classification, information retrieval question generation. Early KE systems commonly operate extractive manner, usually consists two steps: 1) selecting candidates source document using heuristic rules, 2) ranking candidates list determine correct. However, two-step ranking approaches usually based feature engineering, labor-intensive. Motivated progress sequence-to-sequence applications neural networks, KE research's focus gradually shifted deep learning methods. \citet{DBLP:conf/acl/MengZHHBC17} first formulate KE sequence generation problem introduce attentive Seq2Seq framework generate keyphrase sequence conditioned input document. Compared traditional methods, Seq2Seq based method achieves superior performance. Seq2Seq based KE exposed two major challenges: 1) Document-level representation learning. For Seq2Seq generative framework, latent hidden representation important factor, quality directly affect decoder's performance. In KE task, input commonly long document instead sentence, poses greater challenge latent representation learning. 2) Modeling compositionality keyphrases set.

Concretely, we explore to integrate dependency trees with GCN for latent representation learning. Moreover, the graph structure in our model is dynamically modified during the learning process according to the generated keyphrases. To this end, our approach is able to explicitly learn the relations within the keyphrases collection and guarantee the information interchange between encoder and decoder in both directions.

First, syntax-based possibility scores, intuition closer words target word dependency tree input sentence tend better chance opinion words target TOWE.

Despite their success for TOWE, the current deep learning models fail to exploit the syntactic information of the sentences that have been proved to be useful for TOWE in the prior research. In this work, we propose to incorporate the syntactic structures of the sentences into the deep learning models for TOWE, leveraging the syntax-based opinion possibility scores and the syntactic connections between the words. We also introduce a novel regularization technique to improve the performance of the deep learning models based on the representation distinctions between the words in TOWE. The proposed model is extensively analyzed and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets.  %Deep learning models have been shown to achieve the state-of-the-art performance for TOWE in the recent studies.  %While previous feature-based models have shown syntactical structure  is useful for this task, recent deep neural nets ignore this information in their model.

More specifically, our model employs the dependency tree to capture the relative importance of the words to the aspect-term and to encode the connections between words. Our extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets prove the superiority of the proposed model, leading to new state-of-the-art results on all datasets.

"Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis fine-grained version sentiment analysis aims find sentiment polarity input sentences toward given aspect.

In ABSA, goal find sentiment polarity sentence toward given aspect. In literature, two versions aspect proposed: Aspect-category: Aspect categories set pre-defined categories given sentence contains opinion author toward one them. Aspect categories may explicitly appear sentence. Aspect-term: Aspect term subsequent sentence given sentence express sentiment toward it. For instance example The staff polite, quality food terrible., author positive sentiment toward aspect-category service negative sentiment toward aspect-term food.

First, representation vectors words different layers current graph-based models ABSA customized aspect terms.

Recently, it has been shown that dependency trees can be integrated into deep learning models to produce the state-of-the-art performance for ABSA. However, these models tend to compute the hidden/representation vectors without considering the aspect terms and fail to benefit from the overall contextual importance scores of the words that can be obtained from the dependency tree for ABSA. In this work, we propose a novel graph-based deep learning model to overcome these two issues of the prior work on ABSA. In our model, gate vectors are generated from the representation vectors of the aspect terms to customize the hidden vectors of the graph-based models toward the aspect terms. In addition, we propose a mechanism to obtain the importance scores for each word in the sentences based on the dependency trees that are then injected into the model to improve the representation vectors for ABSA. The proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets.  %These models employ graph based neural nets to incorporate syntactical structure into the model. However, they ignore the aspect term information to control the interaction between words in the syntax tree which is modeled by graph neural net.  % Moreover, they neglect the consistency between the syntactic and semantic importance of the words toward the given aspect. %Moreover, the relative importance of the words to the given aspect term based on their syntactical role is neglected in the final representation produced by the existing syntax-aware models. To address these two issues, in this paper, we introduce a new syntax-aware model which incorporates gating mechanism to control information flow in the graph based model using the given aspect term. It also ensures the words that are syntactically important to the aspect term are more pronounced in the final representation of the sentence. Our extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets empirically prove the effectiveness of the proposed model leading to new state-of-the-art results on all three benchmark datasets."

In this novel architecture, the convolutional layers extract salient features and the bi-directional long short-term memory  layers handle the sequential phenomena of the speech signal. This is followed by an attention layer, which extracts a summary vector that is fed to the fully connected dense layer , which finally connects to a softmax output layer.

Recently, graph neural networks  have received increasing attention in the research community and demonstrated their promising results on this canonical task. Despite the success, their performance could be largely jeopardized in practice since they are:  unable to capture high-order interaction between words;  inefficient to handle large datasets and new documents. To address those issues, in this paper, we propose a principled model -- hypergraph attention networks , which can obtain more expressive power with less computational consumption for text representation learning. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach on the text classification task."
"Publicly available biomedical articles keep increasing rapidly. Automated systems utilize biomedical text mining methods necessary able handle large amount data minimal manual effort. An important first step biomedical text mining method detection classification biomedical entities disease, drug chemical mentions biomedical articles. This task referred biomedical named entity recognition . BioNER seen remarkable progress advents machine learning deep learning methods. These methods require labeled datasets benefit increasing amount labeled examples. Artificial neural networks form core almost state-of-the-art bioNER systems. The main drawback methods networks must trained scratch dataset, separately. Even though recent progress BioNER promising, overall performance significantly lower general domain NER. This mainly due scarcity sub-optimal utilization labeled datasets biomedical domain. Transfer learning training paradigm mitigates mentioned issues current approaches. It attempts utilize information obtained source task improve performance target task. Transfer learning shown especially useful size labeled data limited target task, making BioNER suitable target task. Multi-task learning special case transfer learning multiple tasks learned simultaneously. In context, corresponds learning multiple biomedical named entity datasets using single neural network. Recently, seminal work Devlin et al., i.e. BERT model, enabled progress various NLP tasks, including NER. BERT uses self-supervised learning relieves need labeled examples train neural network.

State-of-the-art deep-learning based solutions for entity recognition often require large annotated datasets, which is not available in the biomedical domain. Transfer learning and multi-task learning have been shown to improve performance for low-resource domains. However, the applications of these methods are relatively scarce in the biomedical domain, and a theoretical understanding of why these methods improve the performance is lacking. In this study, we performed an extensive analysis to understand the transferability between different biomedical entity datasets. We found useful measures to predict transferability between these datasets. Besides, we propose combining transfer learning and multi-task learning to improve the performance of biomedical named entity recognition systems, which is not applied before to the best of our knowledge."
"Aspect-based sentiment analysis fine-grained sentiment analysis task, analyzes sentiment opinions toward given aspect sentence. The task consists set subtasks, including aspect category detection, aspect term extraction, aspect-level sentiment classification , aspect-oriented opinion words extraction , etc. Most existing researches perform certain subtask ABSA training machine learning algorithms labeled data. However, public corpora ABSA small-scale due expensive labor-intensive manual annotation. Scarce training data limits performance data-driven approaches ABSA. Therefore, interesting valuable research question mine exploit internal connections ABSA subtasks achieve goal facilitating simultaneously. In work, focus two subtasks ALSC AOWE highly mutually indicative. We first introduce briefly presenting motivations. Aspect-level sentiment classification aims predict sentiment polarity towards given aspect sentence. As Figure shows, two aspects mentioned sentence ``waiters unfriendly pasta world.'', namely ``waiters'' ``pasta''. The sentiments expressed towards aspect negative positive respectively. Different ALSC, aspect-oriented opinion words extraction recently proposed ABSA subtask. The objective task extract corresponding opinion words towards given aspect sentence. Opinion words refer word/phrase sentence used express attitudes opinions explicitly. In example above, ``unfriendly'' opinion word towards aspect ``waiters'', ``out world'' opinion words towards aspect ``pasta''. It common sense positive opinion words imply positive sentiment polarity, negative opinion words correspond negative sentiment polarity. Inspired common sense, find corresponding opinion words toward given aspect help infer corresponding sentiment . Correspondingly, sentiment determined ALSC also provide clues help extract polarity-related opinion words AOWE task. Therefore, goals AOWE ALSC mutually indicative benefit other. To exploit relation mutual indication, propose novel model, Opinion Transmission Network , jointly model two tasks ALSC AOWE finally improve simultaneously. Overall, OTN contains two base modules, namely attention-based ALSC module CNN-based AOWE module, two tailor-made opinion transmission mechanisms, respectively AOWE ALSC ALSC AOWE. Specifically, utilize extracted results AOWE complementary opinions information inject ALSC module form additional attention. To successfully transmit implicit opinions ALSC AOWE, unearth features attention layer ALSC module keep abundant useful aspect-related opinions, utilized facilitate AOWE. It worth noting proposed model works without requiring simultaneous annotations AOWE ALSC data, thus applied practical scenarios.

They respectively aim to detect the sentiment polarity and extract the corresponding opinion words toward a given aspect in a sentence.

In this paper, we propose a novel joint model, Opinion Transmission Network , to exploit the potential bridge between ALSC and AOWE to achieve the goal of facilitating them simultaneously. Specifically, we design two tailor-made opinion transmission mechanisms to control opinion clues flow bidirectionally, respectively from ALSC to AOWE and AOWE to ALSC. Experiment results on two benchmark datasets show that our joint model outperforms strong baselines on the two tasks. Further analysis also validates the effectiveness of opinion transmission mechanisms.  \keywords{Aspect-level sentiment classification  \and Aspect-oriented opinion words extraction \and Opinion transmission network.}"

However, it is not clear what happens during this process and what causes this phenomenon. More specifically, it is not clear whether this is due to the overall change of the model or the impact of certain parameters. In this work, we focus on the domain adaptation task of NMT under the continual learning scenario. First, we put forward two ways for evaluating the importance of the parameters and show that the translation quality mainly dependents on the most important parameters of the model. Then we analyze the behavior of the parameters according to their importance for the model during the continual learning process and it shows that the important parameters for the general-domain translation still play major roles for the in-domain translation after the continual learning process. What's more, the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, shown as the substantial decline of general-domain translation quality with the rise of in-domain translation quality,  is mainly due to the change of these important parameters.  Finally, we propose some practical methods to overcome the catastrophic forgetting by controlling the updates of parameters differently based on their importance.    Neural machine translation  models usually suffer from catastrophic forgetting during continual training where the models tend to gradually forget previously learned knowledge and swing to fit the newly added data which may have a different distribution, e.g. a different domain. Although many methods have been proposed to solve this problem, we cannot get to know what causes this phenomenon yet. Under the background of domain adaptation, we investigate the cause of catastrophic forgetting from the perspectives of modules and parameters . The investigation on the modules of the NMT model shows that some modules have tight relation with the general-domain knowledge while some other modules are more essential in the domain adaptation. And the investigation on the parameters shows that some parameters are important for both the general-domain and in-domain translation and the great change of them during continual training brings about the performance decline in general-domain. We conduct experiments across different language pairs and domains to ensure the validity and reliability of our findings.    %by tracing parameter variation in this progress and depict the influence of different model modules.  %and depict the relationship between them so that we can work out solutions to the catastrophic forgetting problem based on these findings.  %Under the background of domain adaptation for machine translation, we found that some parameters play an essential role in both general domain and in-domain translation and the change of them brings about the performance decline in general-domain. Based on these findings, we propose a solution to detect these important parameters and accordingly suppress their fluctuation during domain adaptation. Experimental results prove  %that our method can greatly improve the translation quality in in-domain and meanwhile minimize the negative influences on general-domain translation."
"Recurrent neural network architectures demonstrated remarkable success natural language processing, achieving state art performance across impressive range tasks ranging machine translation semantic parsing question answering . These tasks demand use wide variety computational processes information sources , evaluated coarse-grained quantitative ways. As result, easy matter identify specific strengths weaknesses network's solution task. In paper, take different tack, exploring degree neural networks successfully master one specific aspect linguistic knowledge: interpretation sentences containing reflexive anaphora. We address problem context task semantic parsing, instantiate mapping sequence words predicate calculus logical form representation sentence's meaning. \pex<ex:transform> \a Mary runs \a John sees Bob \xe Even simple sentences like in~, represent smallest representations object reflexives English, network must learn lexical semantic correspondences mode composition . %Such simple disentangled representations meaning highly successful words learned. Of course, natural language adheres simple formulas. Reflexives, words like himself, interpretation assigned independently meaning surrounding context. \pex<ex:transform-refl> \a Mary sees \a Alice sees \xe In sentences, interpretation reflexive constant combined meaning surrounding elements. Rather, reflexive object must interpreted identical meaning verb's subject. Of course, network could learn context-sensitive interpretation reflexive, sentence \lex{Mary} subject, reflexive interpreted , \lex{Alice} subject interpreted . However, piecemeal learning reflexive meaning support generalization sentences involving subject encountered antecedent reflexive training, even interpretation subject occurred elsewhere. What needed instead interpretation reflexive characterized specific output token, rather abstract instruction duplicate interpretation subject. Such abstraction requires ``jigsaw puzzle"" approach meaning simpler sentences afford. \citet{Marcus98} argues kind abstraction, takes require use algebraic variables assert identity, beyond capacity recurrent neural networks. \citeauthor{Marcus98}'s demonstration involves simple recurrent network language model trained predict next word corpus sentences following form: \pex \a A rose rose. \a A mountain mountain. % \a A car car \xe All sentences training set identical subject object nouns. \citeauthor{Marcus98} shows, however, resulting trained network correctly predict subject noun tested novel preamble `\lex{A book }'. Though intriguing, demonstration entirely convincing: since noun occurring novel preamble, \lex{book} example, occur training data, way network could possibly known output correspond reflexive sentence containing novel subject noun, even network successfully encode identity relation subject object. \citet{frank2013} explore related task context SRN interpretation reflexives. In experiments, SRNs trained map input words corresponding semantic symbols output time step word presented. For words vocabulary, simple task: desired output constant function input . For reflexives however, target output depends subject occurs earlier sentence. \citeauthor{frank2013}\ tested network's ability interpret reflexive sentences containing subject occurred reflexive's antecedent training. However, unlike Marcus' task, subject corresponding semantic symbol occur contexts training data, therefore realm possible inputs outputs network. Nonetheless, none SRNs trained succeeded task even single test example. Since experiments conducted, substantial advances made recurrent neural network architectures, crucial success practical NLP systems. These innovations open possibility modern network architectures may well able solve variable identity problem necessary mapping reflexive sentences logical form. In experiments describe below, explore whether case. In work, focus catastrophic forgetting phenomenon NMT aim find inner reasons this. Under background domain adaptation, propose two analyzing methods perspectives modules parameters conduct experiments across different language pairs domains. We find modules tend maintain general-domain knowledge modules tend adapt in-domain; also find parameters important general-domain in-domain translation change brings performance decline general-domain. Based findings, proposed several ideas may help improve vanilla continual training method. We prove effectiveness ideas future work. The investigation different modules NMT model showed modules higher capacity preserve general-domain knowledge modules essential adapting in-domain; investigation parameters showed parameters important general domain in-domain translation change brings performance decline general-domain.

Then find change important parameters brings performance decline general-domain series analyzing experiments. Finally, based analysis, propose importance evaluation based method alleviate catastrophic forgetting experimental results different languages domains prove effectiveness method."," Reflexive anaphora present a challenge for semantic interpretation: their meaning varies depending on context in a way that appears to require abstract variables. Past work has raised doubts about the ability of recurrent networks to meet this challenge. In this paper, we explore this question in the context of a fragment of English that incorporates the relevant sort of contextual variability. We consider sequence-to-sequence architectures with recurrent units and show that such networks are capable of learning semantic interpretations for reflexive anaphora which generalize to novel antecedents. We explore the effect of attention mechanisms and different recurrent unit types on the type of training data that is needed for success as measured in two ways: how much lexical support is needed  to induce an abstract reflexive meaning  and what contexts must a noun phrase occur in to support generalization of reflexive interpretation to this noun phrase?"
"Pre-trained contextualized language models BERT state-of-the-art wide variety natural language processing tasks. Similarly, Information Retrieval , models brought large improvements task ad-hoc retrieval---ranking documents relevance textual query, models increasingly dominate leaderboards ad-hoc retrieval competitions. Despite success, little understood pretrained language models effective ad-hoc ranking. What new aspects task neural models solve previous approaches not? Previous work shown traditional IR axioms, e.g. increased term frequency correspond higher relevance, explain behavior recent neural models . Outside IR, others examined characteristics contextualized language models learn general , remains unclear qualities valuable ad-hoc ranking task specifically. Thus, new approaches necessary characterize models. We propose new framework aimed Analyzing Behavior Neural IR ModeLs based three testing strategies: ``measure match'', ``textual manipulation'', ``dataset transfer''. The ``measure match'' strategy, akin diagnostic tests proposed by~\citet{Rennings2019AnAA}, constructs test samples controlling one measurement varying another using samples existing IR collection. The ``textual manipulation'' strategy tests effect altering document text ranking. The ``dataset transfer'' strategy constructs tests non-IR datasets. The new tests allow us isolate model characteristics---such sensitivity word order, preference summarized rather full documents---that imperceptible using approaches. We also release open-source implementation framework makes easy define new diagnostics replicate analysis new models. Using new framework, perform first large-scale analysis neural IR models. We compare today's leading ranking techniques, including using BERT T5, well methods focused efficiency like DocT5Query EPIC. We find evidence showing neural models able make effective use textual signals reflected classical term matching methods like BM25. For example, controlling term frequency match, neural models detect document relevance much accurately BM25 baseline, effect pronounced larger neural models. Further, unlike prior approaches, rankers based BERT T5 heavily influenced word order: shuffling words document consistently lowers document's score relative unmodified version. We also find significant differences different neural models: e.g., models treat queries navigationally , BERT-based EPIC model T5 exhibit behaviors. Finally, models exhibit unexpected : adding additional relevant text end document frequently reduce ranking score, adding non-relevant content increase it---despite document length limited effect ranking scores. % In summary, present new framework performing analysis ad-hoc ranking models. We demonstrate framework provide insights ranking model characteristics providing comprehensive analysis neural ranking models date. Our released software framework facilitates conducting analyses future work. Because abstract meaning, reflexive anaphora present distinctive challenge semantic parsing thought beyond capabilities recurrent networks. The experiments described demonstrate incorrect. Sequence-to-sequence networks range recurrent unit types fact capable learning interpretation reflexive pronouns generalizes novel antecedents. Our results also show generalization nonetheless contingent appearance held-out antecedent variety syntactic positions well diversity antecedents providing support reflexive generalization. Additionally successful generalization depends network architecture ways fully understand. It present unknown whether demands architecture impose learning environment successful learning reflexives consistent children experience, could explored corpus experimental work. Future work also necessary elucidate nature networks' representations reflexive interpretation understand support lexical generalization . The question explored related to, distinct from, issue systematicity , according pieces representations learned distinct contexts freely recombine. This issue addressed using sequence-to-sequence architectures recent work synthetic SCAN robot command interpretation dataset language modeling , cases limited success. One aspect SCAN domain particularly relevant reflexive interpretation commands involving adverbial modifiers \lex{twice}. Commands like \lex{jump twice} must interpreted duplicating meaning verb, i.e., , similar require interpretation reflexive object, though way require sensitivity syntactic structure explored here. Recently, \citet{lake2019compositional}, \citet{li-etal-2019-compositional} \citet{Gordon2020Permutation} proposed novel architectures increase systematic behavior, look forward exploring degree impact performance reflexive interpretation. Our current work focused exclusively recurrent networks, ranging SRNs GRUs LSTMs. Recent work \citet{transformer} shows Transformer networks attain superior performance variety sequence-to-sequence tasks dispensing recurrent units altogether. Examining performance training characteristics Transformers allow us compare effects attention recurrence anaphora interpretation task. This especially interesting given impact attention performance experiments. Finally, current experiments revealing capacity recurrent networks learn generalizations context-sensitive interpretation, nonetheless limited number respects simplifications English fragment use create synthetic data. Reflexives famously impose structural requirement antecedents . In following example, reflexive's antecedent must cannot . \ex The student near teacher sees \xe We know whether architectures succeed experiments would similarly well relevant generalization required reference structure. Past work explored sensitivity recurrent networks hierarchical structure, mixed results . In ongoing work, exploring question studying complex synthetic domains kind recurrent sequence-to-sequence network used well networks explicitly encode decode sentences hierarchical manner. A second simplification concerns distribution reflexives themselves. English reflexives appear broader range syntactic environments apart transitive objects . It would considerable interest explore reflexive interpretation naturalistic setting incorporate broader set distributions."," Numerous studies have demonstrated the  effectiveness of pretrained contextualized language models such as BERT and T5 for ad-hoc search. However, it is not well-understood why these methods are so effective, what makes some variants more effective than others, and what pitfalls they may have.  We present a new comprehensive framework for Analyzing the Behavior of Neural IR ModeLs , which includes new types of diagnostic tests that allow us to probe several characteristics---such as sensitivity to word order---that are not addressed by previous techniques.  To demonstrate the value of the framework, we conduct an extensive empirical study that yields insights into the factors that contribute to the neural model's gains, and identify potential unintended biases the models exhibit.  We find evidence that recent neural ranking models have fundamentally different characteristics from prior ranking models. For instance, these models can be highly influenced by altered document word order, sentence order and inflectional endings. They can also exhibit unexpected behaviors when additional content is added to documents, or when documents are expressed with different levels of fluency or formality. We find that these differences can depend on the architecture and not just the underlying language model.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/allenai/abnriml}}"

Commonsense reasoning process logical inference using commonsense information. Commonsense answer questions ``'' Figure depicted as: ``'', ``'', ``.'' An enormous amount pre-defined commonsense knowledge available people make inferences using commonsense following example: ``'' ``'' ``'' ``'' This chain commonsense reasoning naturally deduced humans without substantial difficulty. Whereas people acquire commonsense lives, machines cannot learn knowledge without assistance. A large amount external knowledge several reasoning steps required machines learn commonsense. In recent years, various datasets constructed enable machines reason commonsense. one widely researched datasets presented Figure \subref{subfig:examplea}. The studies commonsense reasoning based dataset categorized two mainstream approaches. The first approach uses pre-trained language models distributed representations, exhibit high performances Natural Language Processing tasks. However, despite high performance, models must trained excessive number parameters cannot explain process commonsense reasoning. The second approach reasoning commonsense knowledge graph. The generally used commonsense knowledge graph ConceptNet 5.5 , includes parsed representation Open Mind Commonsense different language sources WordNet DBPedia . In approach, subgraph ConceptNet corresponding questions transformed node embeddings graph encoder. The candidate highest attention score selected answer computed node embeddings word vectors language models. To learn commonsense knowledge observed understood language models, relations ConceptNet serve critical role method. The performance improved utilizing relations represented text; however, interpretation question still enough. Unlike , commonly used method solving problem Knowledge-Based Question-Answering employing semantic representations. As method infers answer logical structure question using knowledge base, question-answering process explained logical form. In work, Abstract Meaning Representation , one logical structure, used understand overall reasoning process, question answer. AMR graph meaning representation symbolizes meaning sentences. AMR illustrates ``who whom'' implied sentence graph. The components graphs words, rather concepts relations. Each concept denotes event entity, relation represents semantic role concepts. In paper, enable language models exploit AMR graph understand logical structure sentences. However, difficult infer commonsense information AMR graph, owing deficiency commonsense knowledge given sentence. For example, Figure \subref{subfig:exampleb}, AMR graph indicates path logical structure sentence ``'' ; words, paths single AMR graph lack proficient information predict right answer. Therefore, commonsense reasoning, dynamic interactions AMR graph ConceptNet inevitable reach correct answer. Thus, propose new compact AMR graph expanded ConceptNet's commonsense relations pruning, called ACP graph. The proposed method interpret path question answer performing commonsense reasoning within connected graph, ``'' . The contributions study follows. The remainder paper organized follows. In Section 2, present entire process method detail. The experimental setup results explained Section 3. A discussion proposed model provided Section 4, Section 5 presents conclusions. Appendix A provides related works including ConceptNet, previous works commonsense reasoning, AMR. We presented new framework analyzing ranking models based three testing strategies: Measure Match Tests , Textual Manipulation Tests , Dataset Transfer Tests . By using tests, demonstrated variety insights gained behaviors recently-proposed ranking models, based BERT T5. Our analysis is, date, extensive analysis behaviors neural ranking models, sheds light several unexpected model behaviors. For instance, adding non-relevant text increase document's ranking score, even though models largely biased towards longer documents. We also see base language model used different ranking architecture yield different behaviors, higher sensitivity shuffling document's text. Meanwhile, different language models sensitive different characteristics, importance prepositions. \documentclass[11pt,a4paper]{article} \usepackage[table]{xcolor} \usepackage{times,latexsym} \usepackage{url} \usepackage[T1]{fontenc} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{todonotes} \usepackage{booktabs} \usepackage{adjustbox} \usepackage{rotating} \usepackage{layouts} \usepackage{enumitem} \usepackage{afterpage} \usepackage{float} \usepackage{lipsum} \DeclareMathOperator{\sgn}{sgn} \definecolor{pos}{RGB}{76,144,186} \definecolor{neg}{RGB}{222,102,62} \definecolor{art}{RGB}{200,200,200} \setlist[itemize]{noitemsep, topsep=0pt} \hyphenation{Conv-KNRM} \usepackage[acceptedWithA]{tacl2018v2} \usepackage{xspace,mfirstuc,tabulary} \newcommand{\dateOfLastUpdate}{Sept. 20, 2018} \newcommand{\styleFileVersion}{tacl2018v2} \newcommand{\ex}[1]{{\sf #1}} \newcommand{\sys}{ABNIRML} \newif\iftaclinstructions \taclinstructionsfalse \iftaclinstructions \renewcommand{\confidential}{} \renewcommand{\anonsubtext}{} \newcommand{\instr} \fi \iftaclpubformat \newcommand{\taclpaper}{final version\xspace} \newcommand{\taclpapers}{final versions\xspace} \newcommand{\Taclpaper}{Final version\xspace} \newcommand{\Taclpapers}{Final versions\xspace} \newcommand{\TaclPapers}{Final Versions\xspace} \else \newcommand{\taclpaper}{submission\xspace} \newcommand{\taclpapers}{{\taclpaper}s\xspace} \newcommand{\Taclpaper}{Submission\xspace} \newcommand{\Taclpapers}{{\Taclpaper}s\xspace} \newcommand{\TaclPapers}{Submissions\xspace} \fi \newcommand\ac[1]{{\color{brown}\{#1\}}} \newcommand\sergey[1]{{\color{blue}\{#1\}}} \newcommand\doug[1]{{\color{orange}\{#1\}}} \newcommand\sm[1]{{\color{purple}\{#1\}}} \title{\sys: Analyzing Behavior Neural IR Models} \author{ {\bf Sean MacAvaney}\thanks{\xspace \xspace Work done internship AI2} \qquad Sergey Feldman \qquad {\bf Nazli Goharian} \\ {\bf Doug Downey} \qquad {\bf Arman Cohan} \\ IR Lab, Georegetown University, Washington, DC \\ Allen Institute AI, Seattle, WA \\ {\tt\small \{sean,nazli\}@ir.cs.georgetown.edu} \\ {\tt\small \{sergey,dougd,armanc\}@allenai.org} } \date{}"," \texttt{CommonsenseQA} is a task in which a correct answer is predicted through commonsense reasoning with pre-defined knowledge.

Much prior work developing high-quality POS taggers uses neural network methods rely availability large amounts labelled data. However, resources readily available majority world's 7000 languages . Furthermore, manually annotating large amounts text trained experts expensive time-consuming task, even linguists/annotators might native speakers language. Active Learning \cite[AL]{lewis1995evaluating,settles2009active} family methods aim train effective models less human effort cost selecting subset data maximizes end model performance. While many methods proposed AL sequence labeling , empirical study across six typologically diverse languages show within task setup methods perform inconsistently. Furthermore, even oracle scenario % access true labels data selection, existing methods far optimal. We posit primary reason inconsistent performance existing methods consider uncertainty predictions, consider direction uncertainty respect output labels. For instance, Figure consider German token ``die,'' may either pronoun determiner . According initial model , ``die'' labeled PRO majority time, significant amount probability mass also assigned output tags many examples. Based this, existing AL algorithms select uncertain tokens likely select ``die'' frequent predictions certain, may select instance ``die'' either gold label PRO DET. Intuitively, would like correct errors tokens true labels DET mis-labeled model PRO, asking human annotator tag instance true label PRO, even uncertain, likely much benefit. Inspired observation, pose problem AL part-of-speech tagging selecting tokens maximally reduce confusion output tags. For instance, example would attempt pick token-tag pair ``die/DET'' reduce potential errors model over-predicting PRO despite belief DET also plausible option. We demonstrate features model oracle setting know true model confusions , also describe approximate strategy know true confusions. We evaluate proposed AL method running simulation experiments six typologically diverse languages namely German, Swedish, Galician, North Sami, Persian, Ukrainian, improving upon models seeded cross-lingual transfer related languages .

In ConceptNet , real-world assertions represented two nodes directed edges, denote certain concepts relations, respectively. The nodes represent words phrases natural language sentences. The edges represent relations nodes, contain lexical well commonsense relation information. As ConceptNet created collecting data various types knowledge bases, nodes different types also exist. Each node represents slightly different meaning considering role sentence. For example, word ``\texttt{person}'' found concept ``\texttt{person/n},'' analyzed noun POS tagger, detailed semantic information, identified ``\texttt{person/n/wn/body}.'' This information makes possible detailed extraction knowledge considers purpose sentence. Meanwhile, one edges may defined two nodes. For example, edge nodes ``\texttt{person}'' ``\texttt{eat}'' defined independently ``\texttt{CapableOf}'' ``\texttt{Desires}.'' Various concepts relations defined nodes edges ConceptNet, considering ambiguity sentences. Commonsense reasoning. Commonsense reasoning process logical inference using commonsense information. In \texttt{CommonsenseQA}\footnote[1]{https://www.tau-nlp.org/csqa-leaderboard} task, fine-tuning approach pre-trained language representations makes use external commonsense knowledge. There two means exploiting external knowledge. The first\footnote[7]{ttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1sGJBV38aG706EAR75F7LYwCqci9ocG9i/view,\\ https://gist.github.com/commonsensepretraining/507aefddcd00f891c83ebf6936df15e8} method post-trained commonsense sentence corpus. It performs fine-tuning evidence derived questions answers. The second method encode commonsense knowledge graphs train language models. The language models exhibited high performance method BERT , RoBERTa , use bidirectional transformer encoders. They also include XLNet , based autoregressive language modeling, ALBERT , adopts cross-layer parameter sharing factorized embedding parameterization ELECTRA pre-trained Replaced Token Detection task. AMR. AMR represents relations concept nodes using PropBank frameset vocabularies sentences. The edges two concept nodes argument nodes relations. AMR represents semantic roles core numbered roles, uses 100 semantic relations, including negation, conjunction, command, wikification. In PropBank , semantic roles labeled form \texttt{ARG0}\texttt{4} \texttt{ARGM}. In general, \texttt{ARG0} denotes agent verb, \texttt{ARG1} patient, \texttt{ARG2} means instrument, benefactive, attribute, \texttt{ARG3} interpreted starting point, benefactive, attribute, \texttt{ARG4} represents ending point. The root node serves central point representation called frame node. Thereafter, concept nodes sequentially combined according semantic relations. AMR consists concept nodes single graph traversable nodes, similar parse tree. However, unlike parse tree, represents explicit structure sentences, AMR aims describe conceptual semantic structure. That is, semantic meanings explicitly different sentences same, represented AMR graph. For example, two sentences ``\texttt{The boy hard worker}'' ``\texttt{The boy works hard}'' represented PENMAN graph, namely \texttt{ :manner )}. The data constructed generate evaluate representations AMR 2.0 AMR 1.0 . The model highest performance data presented Zhang et al. \shortcite{zhang2019amr:2019}, using BERT. Various NLP fields exploited AMR, sentence generation , summarization , question answering , dialogue systems , paraphrase detection , biomedical text mining ."," Active learning  uses a data selection algorithm to select useful training samples to minimize annotation cost. This is now an essential tool for building low-resource syntactic analyzers such as part-of-speech  taggers. Existing AL heuristics are generally designed on the principle of selecting uncertain yet representative training instances, where annotating these instances may reduce a large number of errors. However, in an empirical study across six typologically diverse languages , we found the surprising result that even in an oracle scenario where we know the true uncertainty of predictions, these current heuristics are far from optimal. Based on this analysis, we pose the problem of AL as selecting instances which maximally reduce the confusion between particular pairs of output tags. Extensive experimentation on the aforementioned languages shows that our proposed AL strategy outperforms other AL strategies by a significant margin.  We also present auxiliary results demonstrating the importance of proper calibration of models, which we ensure through cross-view training, and analysis demonstrating how our proposed strategy selects examples that more closely follow the oracle data distribution.

"With increasing submission academic papers recent years, task making final decisions manually incurs significant overheads program chairs, desirable automate process. In study, aim utilizing document-level semantic analysis paper review rating prediction recommendation. Given reviews paper several reviewers input, goal infer final acceptance decision paper reviewers' evaluation respect numeric rating . Paper review rating prediction recommendation practical important task AI applications help improve efficiency paper review process. It also intended enhance consistency assessment procedures outcomes, diversify paper review process comparing human recommended rating machine recommended rating. In literature, existing studies cast review rating prediction multi-class classification/regression task . They build predictor using supervised machine learning models review texts corresponding ratings. Due importance features, researches focus extracting effective features context-level features user features boost prediction performance. However, feature engineering time-consuming labor-intensive. Recently, development neural networks wide applications, various deep learning-based models proposed automatically learning features text data . Existing deep learning models usually learn continuous representations different grains text corpus . Although deep learning models automatically learn extensive feature representation, cannot efficiently capture hierarchical relationship inherent review data. To address problem, studied hierarchical architecture implemented deep learning framework learn better document-level representation. Also, success attention mechanism many tasks machine translation, question answering , designed directional self-attention network gain context-aware embeddings words sentences. Despite great progress made models, focus task paper review rating recommendation effective enough directly used task following reasons: First, review data hierarchical nature. There exists three-level hierarchical structure review data: word level, intra-review level inter-review level, previous models capture two-levels hierarchy. Second, paper reviews usually much longer reviews , models working shorter reviews stated leverage date representation techniques BERT SciBERT . In paper, propose novel neural network framework paper review rating recommendation taking word, intra-review inter-review information account.

However, most existing methods either use hand-crafted features or learn features using deep learning with simple text corpus as input for review rating prediction, ignoring the hierarchies among data.  In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical bi-directional self-attention Network framework  for paper review rating prediction and recommendation, which can serve as an effective decision-making tool for the academic paper review process. Specifically, we leverage the hierarchical structure of the paper reviews with three levels of encoders: sentence encoder , intra-review encoder  and inter-review encoder .  Each encoder first derives contextual representation of each level, then generates a higher-level representation, and after the learning process, we are able to identify useful predictors to make the final acceptance decision, as well as to help discover the inconsistency between numerical review ratings and text sentiment conveyed by reviewers.  Furthermore, we introduce two new metrics to evaluate models in data imbalance situations.  Extensive experiments on a publicly available dataset  and our own collected dataset  demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach compared with state-of-the-art methods."
"% What QG Why important Question Generation aims endow machines ability ask relevant to-the-point questions document. QG important practical applications, generating assessments course materials education, prompting user interaction dialog systems, enabling machines ask clarification questions FAQs, automatically building large-scale QA datasets research community. % How tranditional works it? Recent QG approaches used Seq2Seq models attention, feeds input document encoder, generates question document decoder. % Why needs RL? The training objective maximize log likelihood ground-truth question paired input document using teacher forcing. However, ground-truth questions insufficient account many equivalent ways asking question, likelihood-based training suffers problem exposure bias, i.e., model learn distribute probability mass sequences valid different ground truth. % How RL addresses problem? % To address issue, previous QG works proposed optimize model directly question-specific rewards via Reinforcement Learning . This process decouples training procedure ground truth data, space possible questions better explored. Moreover, allows training target specific properties want question exhibit, relevant specific topic answerable document. % What problem RL-based method? Although various rewards employed QG --- BLEU, answerability reward, word movers distance --- optimizing reward scores always lead higher question quality practice, observed Hosking Riedel~\shortcite{Hosking2019EvaluatingRF}. How define robust effective QG-specific rewards still requires investigation. % What want do? We aim analyze effectiveness question-specific rewards QG. Instead using general natural language generation metrics BLEU, target three QG-related metrics commonly cited human evaluations question quality: Fluency indicates whether question follows grammar accords correct logic; Relevance indicates whether question relevant document; Answerability indicates whether question answerable given document. We design specific RL reward metric: language model based reward fluency, discriminator-based reward relevance, QA-based reward answerability. After optimizing reward via RL, conduct comprehensive analysis, including automatic human evaluation, arrive following conclusions: individual joint optimization rewards lead performance gain automated metrics, guarantee improvement real question quality; reward relevance substantially helps improve question quality, reward answerability reduces quality due bias brought QA model; reward likely improve question quality reward score correlates well human judgement. In paper, scientific paper review dataset called OpenReview collected ICLR openreview website released.

Based observations, hierarchical bi-directional self-attention network framework proposed paper review rating prediction recommendation model interactions among words, sentences, intra- inter-reviews end-to-end manner. Moreover, considering imbalanced distribution different classes review rating prediction task, design two new metrics better evaluate models. It seen experimental results predicting final decisions submitted papers identifying ratings reviews two datasets demonstrate proposed framework sufficient ability capture hierarchical structures words, sentences reviews datasets outperforms models. In future, plan investigate multi-task learning paper review rating recommendation.","     Recent question generation  approaches often utilize the sequence-to-sequence framework  to optimize the log likelihood of ground-truth questions using teacher forcing. However, this training objective is inconsistent with actual question quality, which is often reflected by certain global properties such as whether the question can be answered by the document. As such, we directly optimize for QG-specific objectives via reinforcement learning to improve question quality. We design three different rewards that target to improve the fluency, relevance, and answerability of generated questions. We conduct both automatic and human evaluations in addition to thorough analysis to explore the effect of each QG-specific reward.      We find that optimizing on question-specific rewards generally leads to better performance in automatic evaluation metrics. However, only the rewards  that correlate well with human judgement  lead to real improvement in question quality. Optimizing for the others, especially answerability, introduces incorrect bias to the model, resulting in poor question quality.

Specifically, encoder finds multi-layer representation source sentence, decoder queries topmost encoding representation produce target sentence cross-attention mechanism . However, over-reliance topmost encoding layer problematic two aspects: Prone over-fitting, especially encoder under-trained, low-resource tasks ; It cannot make full use representations extracted lower encoder layers, syntactically semantically complementary higher layers . Researchers proposed many methods make model aware various encoder layers besides topmost mitigate issue. Almost resort adjustment network structure, divided two categories. The first merge feature representations extracted distinct encoder layers fed decoder . The differences lie design merge function: self-attention , recurrent neural network , tree-like hierarchical merge . Moreover, second makes decoder layer explicitly align parallel encoder layer encoder layers . However, methods either complicate original model limit model's flexibility, requiring number encoder layers decoder layers . Instead, work, propose layer-wise multi-view learning address problem perspective model training, without changing model structure. Our method's highlight training process concerned, inference speed guaranteed standard model. The core idea regard off-the-shelf output encoding layer view input sentence. Therefore, straightforward cheap construct multiple views standard layer-by-layer encoding process. Further, addition output topmost encoder layer used standard models , also incorporate intermediate encoder layer auxiliary view. We feed two views partially shared decoder independent predictions. An additional regularization loss based prediction consistency views used encourage auxiliary view mimic primary view.

Future direction would extending approach language models, wells experiment combination high low resources Glue SuperGlue benchmark evaluate model performance.","   Traditional neural machine translation is limited to the topmost encoder layer's context representation and cannot directly perceive the lower encoder layers. Existing solutions usually rely on the adjustment of network architecture, making the calculation more complicated or introducing additional structural restrictions. In this work, we propose layer-wise multi-view learning to solve this problem, circumventing the necessity to change the model structure.    We regard each encoder layer's off-the-shelf output, a by-product in layer-by-layer encoding, as the redundant view for the input sentence.   In this way, in addition to the topmost encoder layer , we also incorporate an intermediate encoder layer as the auxiliary view.    We feed the two views to a partially shared decoder to maintain independent prediction.     Consistency regularization based on KL divergence is used to encourage the two views to learn from each other.   Extensive experimental results on five translation tasks show that our approach yields stable improvements over multiple strong baselines. As another bonus, our method is agnostic to network architectures and can maintain the same inference speed as the original model."
"% . } % Emotion analysis established research area finds application variety different fields, including social media analysis \cite[i.a.]{Purver2012,Wang2012b,Mohammad2017,Ying2019}, opinion mining \cite[i.a.]{Choi2006}, computational literary studies \cite[i.a.]{Ovesdotter2005,Kimfanfic2019,Haider2020,Zehe2020}. The prominent task emotion analysis emotion categorization, text receives assignments predefined emotion inventory, fundamental emotions \fear, \anger, \joy, \anticipation, \trust, \surprise, \disgust, \sadness follow theories . Other tasks include recognition affect values, namely valence arousal analyses event appraisal . More recently, categorization tasks complemented fine-grained analyses, namely emotion stimulus detection role labeling, detect words denote experiencer emotion, emotion cue description, target emotion. These efforts lead computational approaches detecting stimulus clauses emotion role labeling sequence labeling , different advantages disadvantages discuss . Further, work led rich set corpora annotations different subsets roles. An example sentence annotated semantic role labels emotion ``\experiencer{John} \cue{hates} \target{cars} \stimulus{pollute environment}.'' A number English-language resources available: manually construct dataset following FrameNet's emotion predicate annotate stimulus core argument. annotate Tweets emotion cue phrases, emotion targets, emotion stimulus. In previous work publish news headlines annotated roles emotion experiencer, cue, target, stimulus. annotate sentence triples taken literature roles. A popular benchmark emotion stimulus detection Mandarin corpus . annotate English Mandarin texts comparable way clause level . In paper, utilize role annotations understand influence emotion classification. We evaluate roles' contents enable emotion classifier infer emotions. It reasonable assume roles' content carries different kinds information regarding emotion: One particular experiencer present corpus might always feel emotion; hence, prone bias model could pick on. The target stimulus might independent experiencer sufficient infer emotion. The presence target might limit set emotions triggered. Finally, corpora contain cue annotations, assume helpful decide expressed emotion, typically explicit references towards concrete emotion names. We studied incorporate different encoder layers multi-view learning neural machine translation. In addition primary view topmost layer, proposed model introduces auxiliary view intermediate encoder layer encourages transfer knowledge two views. Our method agnostic network architecture maintain inference speed original model. We tested method five translation tasks multiple strong baselines: Transformer, deep Transformer, DynamicConv. Experimental results show multi-view learning method stably outperform baseline models. Our models achieved new state-of-the-art results KoEn IWSLT'14 DeEn tasks.","   Emotion recognition is predominantly formulated as text classification in   which textual units are assigned to an emotion from a predefined inventory   .   More recently, semantic role labeling approaches have been developed to   extract structures from the text to answer questions like: ``who is   described to feel the emotion?'' , ``what causes this   emotion?'' , and at   which entity is it directed?'' . Though it has been shown that   jointly modeling stimulus and emotion category   prediction is beneficial for both subtasks, it remains unclear which of   these semantic roles enables a classifier to infer the emotion. Is it the   experiencer, because the identity of a person is biased towards a   particular emotion ? Is it a particular target    or a stimulus ? We   answer these questions by training emotion classification models on five   available datasets annotated with at least one semantic role by masking the   fillers of these roles in the text in a controlled manner and find that   across multiple corpora, stimuli and targets carry emotion information,   while the experiencer might be considered a confounder.  Further, we   analyze if informing the model about the position of the role improves the   classification decision. Particularly on literature corpora we find that   the role information improves the emotion classification."

"A relational triple consists two entities connected semantic relation, form . The extraction relational triples unstructured raw texts key technology automatic knowledge graph construction, received growing interest recent years. There several studies addressing technical solutions relational triple extraction. Early researches, \citet{zelenko2003kernel,chan2011exploiting}, employ pipeline manner extract entities relations, entities recognized first relation extracted entities predicted. Such pipeline approach ignores relevance entity identification relation prediction tends suffer error propagation problem. % To model cross-task dependencies explicitly prevent error propagation pipeline approach, subsequent studies propose joint entity relation extraction. These studies roughly categorized three main paradigms. The first stream work, \citet{miwa2016end,gupta2016table,zhang2017end}, treats joint entity relation extraction task end-to-end table filling problem. Although methods represent entities relations shared parameters single model, extract entities relations separately produce redundant information . The second stream work, \citet{zheng2017joint,dai2019joint,wei-etal-2020-novel}, transforms joint entity relation extraction sequence labeling. To this, human experts need design complex tagging schema. The last stream work, including \citet{zeng2018extracting,zeng2019learning,nayak2019ptrnetdecoding,zeng2020copymtl}, driven sequence-to-sequence model generate relational triples directly, flexible framework handle overlapping triples require substantial effort human experts. We follow seq2seq based models joint entity relation extraction. Despite success existing seq2seq based models, still limited autoregressive decoder cross-entropy loss. The reasons follows: relational triples contained sentence intrinsic order essence. However, order adapt autoregressive decoder, whose output sequence, unordered target triples must sorted certain order training phase. Meanwhile, cross-entropy permutation-sensitive loss function, penalty incurred every triple predicted position. Consequently, current seq2seq base models need learn generate triples, also required consider extraction order multiple triples. % consists three parts featured transformers non-autoregressive parallel decoding bipartite matching loss. In detail, three parts proposed set prediction networks : avoid introducing order triplets % restoring original form task without considering order multiple triples In work, formulate joint entity relation extraction task set prediction problem, avoiding considering order multiple triples. In order solve set prediction problem, propose end-to-end network featured transformers non-autoregressive parallel decoding bipartite matching loss. In detail, three parts proposed set prediction networks : sentence encoder, set generator, set based loss function. First all, adopt BERT model encoder represent sentence. Then, since autoregressive decoder must generate items one one order, decoder suitable generating unordered sets. In contrast, leverage transformer-based non-autoregressive decoder set generator, predict triples avoid sorting triples. Finally, order assign predicted triple unique ground truth triple, propose bipartite matching loss function inspired assigning problem operation research . Compared cross-entropy loss highly penalizes small shifts triple order, proposed loss function invariant permutation predictions; thus suitable evaluating difference ground truth set prediction set. % To summarize, contributions follows: In nutshell, main contributions are: % main contributions work follows: % conjunction bipartite matching loss transformers % parallel decoding % Our work build prior work several domains:relation extraction, non-autoregressive model, andbipartite matching losses set prediction. % Relation Extraction. Non-autoregressive Model. We found large gaps performance two systems across two domains, result conclusive due several reasons, follows. 1, 2 The neural system shows weakness long documents novel corpus, also needs training data reach full potential. 3, 4 The rule-based system better adapted SoNaR-1 annotation scheme, neural system's capacity adapt arbitrary annotation conventions necessarily imply better linguistic performance. 5 To maximize comparability usefulness corpora, annotations harmonized, involves manual mention annotation. In future work want improve neural system using genre metadata finetuning BERT, rule-based system extended hybrid system adding supervised classifiers."," The joint entity and relation extraction task aims to extract all relational triples from a sentence. In essence, the relational triples contained in a sentence are unordered. However, previous seq2seq based models require to convert the set of triples into a sequence in the training phase. To break this bottleneck, we treat joint entity and relation extraction as a direct set prediction problem, so that the extraction model can get rid of the burden of predicting the order of multiple triples. To solve this set prediction problem, we propose networks featured by transformers with non-autoregressive parallel decoding. Unlike autoregressive approaches that generate triples one by one in a certain order, the proposed networks directly output the final set of triples in one shot. Furthermore, we also design a set-based loss that forces unique predictions via bipartite matching. Compared with cross-entropy loss that highly penalizes small shifts in triple order, the proposed bipartite matching loss is invariant to any permutation of predictions; thus, it can provide the proposed networks with a more accurate training signal by ignoring triple order and focusing on relation types and entities. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our proposed model significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

"Zero-shot translation first introduced \citet{firat-etal-2016-zero} refers ability multilingual NMT model translate source target languages, even pairs parallel data seen training.

While capability attractive alternative building dedicated translation systems serve languages, performance zero-shot pairs tends lag behind pivot translation.

We find relation types exhibit imbalanced long-tailed distribution NYT dataset WebNLG dataset. Our future work concentrate combine cost-sensitive learning proposed set prediction networks."," Zero-shot neural machine translation is an attractive goal because of the high cost of obtaining data and building translation systems for new translation directions. However, previous papers have reported mixed success in zero-shot translation. It is hard to predict in which settings it will be effective, and what limits performance compared to a fully supervised system. In this paper, we investigate zero-shot performance of a multilingual EN$\leftrightarrow$\{FR,CS,DE,FI\} system trained on WMT data. We find that zero-shot performance is highly unstable and can vary by more than 6 BLEU between training runs, making it difficult to reliably track improvements. We observe a bias towards copying the source in zero-shot translation, and investigate how the choice of subword segmentation affects this bias. We find that language-specific subword segmentation results in less subword copying at training time, and leads to better zero-shot performance compared to jointly trained segmentation. A recent trend in multilingual models is to not train on parallel data between all language pairs, but have a single bridge language, e.g.\ English. We find that this negatively affects zero-shot translation and leads to a failure mode where the model ignores the language tag and instead produces English output in zero-shot directions.  We show that this bias towards English can be effectively reduced with even a small amount of parallel data in some of the non-English pairs."
"Entrainment well-known psycholinguistic phenomenon causing people adapt conversation partners become similar. It affects many linguistic features including phonetics , lexical choice , syntax , prosody . Importantly, correlates interesting aspects conversation task success, liking, even rapport robot . The researchers cited employed various means measure entrainment, correlations, models conditional probabilities, comparisons distributions, perceived similarity. Recently, \citet{Nasir2018} proposed first neural entrainment measure. Our work builds addressing challenge critical measuring entrainment: accounting consistency. Entrainment defined active, though unconscious, adaptation speaker towards partner. In practice, however, static similarity correlation two speakers often measured. Thus, even two speakers whose vocal characteristics initially similar perceived entrained, although adaptation taken place. Alternatively, Speaker B entrains Speaker A, speakers perceived entrained, without adaptation Speaker A.

Isolating the effect of consistency, i.e., speakers adhering to their individual styles, is a critical part of the analysis of entrainment. We propose to treat speakers' initial vocal features as confounds for the prediction of subsequent outputs. Using two existing neural approaches to deconfounding, we define new measures of entrainment that control for consistency. These successfully discriminate real interactions from fake ones. Interestingly, our stricter methods correlate with social variables in opposite direction from previous measures that do not account for consistency. These results demonstrate the advantages of using neural networks to model entrainment, and raise questions regarding how to interpret prior associations of conversation quality with entrainment measures that do not account for consistency."
"The proliferation online hate speech become prevalent recent times. Numerous social media outlets computational social science community looking various automated techniques detect classify hate speech. However, models, nascent nature, significant limitations due complexity problem. Primarily, lack reliable baseline coupled evolving vocabulary hateful content makes particularly challenging issue. For instance, many studies classified problem binary classification task, fails address subtleties hate speech, direct vs. indirect hate speech. These binary classification models also fail identify different types hate speech like racism, sexism, antisemitism, etc. varying degrees.

Online hate speech on social media has become a fast-growing problem in recent times. Nefarious groups have developed large content delivery networks across several mainstream  and fringe outlets  to deliver cascades of hate messages directed both at individuals and communities. Thus addressing these issues has become a top priority for large-scale social media outlets. Three key challenges in automated detection and classification of hateful content are the lack of clearly labeled data, evolving vocabulary and lexicon - hashtags, emojis, etc - and the lack of baseline models for fringe outlets such as Gab. In this work, we propose a novel framework with three major contributions.  We engineer an ensemble of deep learning models that combines the strengths of state-of-the-art approaches,  we incorporate a tuning factor into this framework that leverages transfer learning to conduct automated hate speech classification on unlabeled datasets, like Gab, and  we develop a weak supervised learning methodology that allows our framework to train on unlabeled data. Our ensemble models achieve an 83\% hate recall on the HON dataset, surpassing the performance of the state of the art deep models. We demonstrate that weak supervised training in combination with classifier tuning significantly increases model performance on unlabeled data from Gab, achieving a hate recall of 67\%."

For this, most existing approaches learn embeddings of text and network structure by enforcing embeddings of connected nodes to be similar. Then for achieving a modality fusion they use the similarities between text embedding of a node with the structure embedding of its connected node and vice versa. %Then for achieving modality fusion they model intra-modal similarities involving networks structure and textual attributes of  nodes in an edge.  This implies that these approaches require edge information for learning embeddings and they cannot learn embeddings of unseen nodes. In this paper we propose an approach that achieves both modality fusion and the capability to learn embeddings of unseen nodes. The main feature of our model is that it uses an adversarial mechanism between text embedding based discriminator, and structure embedding based generator to learn efficient representations. Then for learning embeddings of unseen nodes, we use the supervision provided by the text embedding based discriminator. In addition this, we propose a novel architecture for learning text embedding that can combine both mutual attention and topological attention mechanism, which give more flexible text embeddings. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our model makes substantial gains over several state-of-the-art benchmarks. In comparison with previous state-of-the-art, it gives up to 7\% improvement in performance in predicting links among nodes seen in the training and up to 12\% improvement in performance in predicting links involving nodes not seen in training. Further, in the node classification task, it gives up to 2\% improvement in performance."

We show that the Ar-RNN-T loss provides a refined control to navigate the trade-offs between the token emission delays and the Word Error Rate . The Ar-RNN-T models also improve downstream applications such as the ASR End-pointing by guaranteeing token emissions within any given range of latency. Moreover, the Ar-RNN-T loss allows for bigger batch sizes and 4 times higher throughput for our LSTM model architecture, enabling faster training and convergence on GPUs."

Previous work, in particular, has focused on representing internal components of neural networks through human-friendly visuals and concepts. On the other hand, in real life, when making a decision, human tends to rely on similar situations and/or associations in the past. Hence arguably, a promising approach to make the model transparent is to design it in a way such that the model explicitly connects the current sample with the seen ones, and bases its decision on these samples.   Grounded on that principle, we propose in this paper an explainable, evidence-based memory network architecture, which learns to summarize the dataset and extract supporting evidences to make its decision. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two popular question answering datasets . Via further analysis, we show that this model can reliably trace the errors it has made in the validation step to the training instances that might have caused these errors.

However, existing methods usually focus on measuring the matching degree between the dialog context and sticker image, which ignores the user preference of using stickers.   Hence, in this paper, we propose to recommend an appropriate sticker to user based on multi-turn dialog context and sticker using history of user.   Two main challenges are confronted in this task.   One is to model the sticker preference of user based on the previous sticker selection history.   Another challenge is to jointly fuse the user preference and the matching between dialog context and candidate sticker into final prediction making.   To tackle these challenges, we propose a Preference Enhanced Sticker Response Selector  model.   Specifically, PESRS first employs a convolutional based sticker image encoder and a self-attention based multi-turn dialog encoder to obtain the representation of stickers and utterances.   Next, deep interaction network is proposed to conduct deep matching between the sticker and each utterance.   Then, we model the user preference by using the recently selected stickers as input, and use a key-value memory network to store the preference representation.   PESRS then learns the short-term and long-term dependency between all interaction results by a fusion network, and dynamically fuse the user preference representation into the final sticker selection prediction.   Extensive experiments conducted on a large-scale real-world dialog dataset show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance for all commonly-used metrics.   Experiments also verify the effectiveness of each component of PESRS.   %"

Better understandings NMT models could guide us improving NMT systems. Currently studies towards understanding NMT models take account subword-based models.

CHAR models pose new challenges interpretability, investigate whether probe CHAR models way similar word-based models. In addition, extract word sense morphological information full word individual hidden states, information distributed across multiple states? This implications interpreting neural CHAR models, also inform novel architectures, sparse attention mechanisms. Thus first investigate ability CHAR models learn word senses morphology Section . We apply different methods compose information characters demonstrate word-level information distributed characters characters different positions play different roles learning linguistic knowledge. We also explore effect encoder depth answer CHAR models outperform BPE-based models settings deeper encoder. The probing results show CHAR models need layers learn word senses. Then Section , move explore attention mechanism. The distribution pattern shows separators attract much attention compared characters. To study effect enforcing characters capture full word-level information, investigate sparse attention mechanism, i.e. model attends separators, viewed word-level attention. The BLEU score drops 1.2 points apply word-level sparse attention. This implies attending separators single attention head workable enough extract necessary information. The main findings summarized follows: In previous work, propose task multi-turn sticker response selection, recommends appropriate sticker based multi-turn dialog context history without relying external knowledge.

However, it is still unclear what makes deeper character-based models successful. In this paper, we conduct an investigation into pure character-based models in the case of translating Finnish into English, including exploring the ability to learn word senses and morphological inflections and the attention mechanism. We demonstrate that word-level information is distributed over the entire character sequence rather than over a single character, and characters at different positions play different roles in learning linguistic knowledge. In addition, character-based models need more layers to encode word senses which explains why only deeper models outperform subword-based models. The attention distribution pattern shows that separators attract a lot of attention and we explore a sparse word-level attention to enforce character hidden states to capture the full word-level information. Experimental results show that the word-level attention with a single head results in 1.2 BLEU points drop."

"Task-oriented dialog systems commonplace automated systems interact end users, including digital assistants, technical support agents, various website navigation helpers. An essential part task-oriented dialog system natural language generation , consumes data, typically fed form dialog act, converts natural language output served end user. The natural language response NLG component 1) contain essential information, 2) contextualized around user request, 3) natural sounding. Such system requires consideration content planning, correctness, grammaticality, naturalness. NLG systems employed commercial settings typically based template-based text generation techniques . In these, humans author minimal set responses templates placeholder slot values. These slots later filled runtime, dialog input. Although template-based NLG modules appealing due deterministic nature, inherent correctness, low latency, major drawbacks: First, separate templates need authored different response variations; behavior unfavorable scaling. Second, templates authored particular domain commonly reusable. Lastly, matter complexity language instilled templates, form strictly discrete set responses, therefore bound limited response naturalness. More recently, advances neural-network-based language generation prompted new direction NLG research .

Traditionally, NLG components have been deployed using template-based solutions. Although neural network solutions recently developed in the research community have been shown to provide several benefits, deployment of such model-based solutions has been challenging due to high latency, correctness issues, and high data needs.  In this paper, we present approaches that have helped us deploy data-efficient neural solutions for NLG in conversational systems to production.  We describe a family of sampling and modeling techniques to attain production quality with light-weight neural network models using only a fraction of the data that would be necessary otherwise, and show a thorough comparison between each. Our results show that domain complexity dictates the appropriate approach to achieve high data efficiency. Finally, we distill the lessons from our experimental findings into a list of best practices for production-level NLG model development, and present them in a brief runbook. Importantly, the end products of all of the techniques are small sequence-to-sequence models  that we can reliably deploy in production."

Then, calibration model conducts finer search within detected region neighborhood, focuses local context refine boundary. This analogous human perception cognition process, first locates target, sets local context, finally zooms details. Our design novel sequence labeling, orthogonal complements existing approaches. Using second model focus detecting answer boundaries accurately intuitive nice idea. However, construct high-quality training data calibration model remains challenging. One straightforward method transform original training data sequence labeling task new training set calibration model. However, data collected way still quite limited, especially low-resource languages. To address challenge, strategically propose novel phrase boundary recovery task pre-train model large-scale augmented datasets synthesized Wikipedia documents multiple languages. The new pre-training approach dramatically improves capability calibration module determine answer boundaries accurately. % Besides design employing two models, equip calibration model pre-training process emphasizing capability recovering meaningful phrases noisy input. Our approach shown Figure. CalibreNet consists two modules, base module calibration module. The base module take model sequence labeling. The predicted answers base module combined input sequence form input calibration module. The calibration module considers initial results base module whole passage refine span boundaries. In particular, calibration module pre-trained PBR task large-scale multilingual synthesized data Wikipedia-derived corpus. We make following technical contributions paper. First, propose CalibreNet framework task cross-lingual sequence labeling improve accuracy labeled answers. Second, propose novel phrase boundary recovery task weakly supervised pre-training method using Wikipedia data. This approach effectively enhances model sensitivity phrase boundaries.

One major obstacle is the errors on the boundary of predicted answers. To tackle this problem, we propose CalibreNet, which predicts answers in two steps. In the first step, any existing sequence labeling method can be adopted as a base model to generate an initial answer. In the second step, CalibreNet refines the boundary of the initial answer. To tackle the challenge of lack of training data in low-resource languages, we dedicatedly develop a novel unsupervised phrase boundary recovery pre-training task to enhance the multilingual boundary detection capability of CalibreNet. Experiments on two cross-lingual benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach achieves SOTA results on zero-shot cross-lingual NER and MRC tasks."

However, for case management and referral to psychiatrists, healthcare workers require practical and scalable depressive disorder screening and triage system. % for prevention or treatment of severe consequences.  This study aims to design and evaluate a decision support system  to reliably determine the depressive triage level by capturing fine-grained depressive symptoms expressed in user tweets through the emulation of Patient Health Questionnaire-9 \texttt{} that is routinely used in clinical practice. %However, the 280-character limit on tweets incentivizes the usage of creative artifacts in the utterances.  %Figurative language forms a general fabric of communication as it permits users to express themselves more effectively.  %Unfortunately, this complicates the reliable detection of depressive symptoms.  The reliable detection of depressive symptoms from tweets is challenging because the 280-character limit on tweets incentivizes the use of creative artifacts in the utterances and figurative usage contributes to effective expression.   We propose a novel BERT based robust multi-task learning framework to accurately identify the depressive symptoms using the auxiliary task of figurative usage detection. Specifically, our proposed novel task sharing mechanism, co-task aware attention\/, enables automatic selection of optimal information across the BERT layers and tasks by soft-sharing of parameters. Our results show that modeling figurative usage can demonstrably improve the model's robustness and reliability for distinguishing the depression symptoms. %Furthermore, our approach achieves statistically significant improvements over the SOTA models.  % Social media platforms have evolved as a vital source of information for mental-health studies, where the users exchange their emotional states and impressions. Majority of the existing studies on depression focus mainly on the depression detection task.

This study aims to design and evaluate a decision support system  to % determine the depressive triage level by capturing fine-grained depressive symptoms appearing in depressed users tweets through emulating the clinically adopted Patient Health Questionnaire-9 \texttt{\texttt{PHQ-9}}.\\ % Nevertheless, the limitation on characters imposed by Twitter incentivize the usage of creative artifacts that are widely observed in the utterance of depressive users. Figurative language, such as metaphor, irony, and sarcasm forms a general fabric of communication as it permit users to express their health condition more memorably, concisely, and effectively. Inspired by that, we proposed a novel BERT based multi-task learning framework that learns to accurately identify the symptoms using the auxiliary task of figurative language detection. Specifically, we propose a new task sharing mechanism: co-task aware attention, which helps the model to borrow the new information across the task. With the help of soft-sharing of the parameters, our framework automatically detect and select optimal information across the layers of the BERT, that are useful for a task at hand. % The obtained results proves that modeling figurative language in depressive user tweets can improve the model learning ability in correctly distinguishing the symptoms. Furthermore, our proposed approach achieve statistically significant improvements over the state-of-the-art models on our primary task."

"The goal relation extraction extract relationships two entities plain text. Supervised learning methods relation extraction widely used extract relations based training labeled data. Distant supervision crowdsourcing used collect examples labels train model relation extraction. However, methods limited quantity quality training data manually labeling data time-consuming labor-intensive data labeled distant-supervision noisy. To overcome problem insufficient high-quality data, few-shot learning designed require labeled sentences training. A lot research done few-shot learning computer vision~, work also includes few-shot learning methods relation extraction~. Although works require instances training, still work many scenarios training instances available. Some work open information extraction discovers new relationships open-domain corpora without labeling data. OpenIE aims extract relation phrases directly text. However, technique effectively select meaningful relation patterns discard irrelevant information. In addition, technique discover relations relation's name appear given sentence. For example, OpenIE identify relation sentence shown Figure. To address aforementioned limitations, focus relation extraction context zero-shot learning. Zero-shot learning similar way humans learn recognize new concepts. It novel learning technique use exemplars unseen categories training. We propose zero-shot learning model relation extraction , focuses recognizing new relations corresponding labeled data available training. ZSLRE modified prototypical networks utilizing side information. We construct side information labels synonyms, hypernyms two name entities keywords training sentences. The ZSL-based model recognize new relations based side information available instead using collection labeled sentences. We incorporate side information enable model extract relations never appear training datasets. We also build automatic hypernym extraction framework help us acquire hypernyms different entities directly web. Details side information construction described Section Side Information Extraction. Figure shows example side information used extract relations. Different side information given different relations. The query sentence example relation classmate\_of, word classmate never appears sentence. We first get two name entities Nell Newman Mayday Parker sentence extract hypernyms name entities person person based proposed hypernym extraction module Section Hypernyms Extraction. In example, relationship capital\_of eliminated hypernyms capital\_of location location. Then extract keywords course school query sentence compare distance keywords side information box. In way, relationship children\_of eliminated. To make relation extraction effective real-world scenarios, design models ability extract relations training instances relations without training instances. We modify vanilla prototypical networks deal scenarios compare distance query sentence prototype. If exponential minus distance threshold, consider query sentence new relation. For new relations extraction, take side information embedding query sentence compare distance side information embedding new relations. We conduct different experiments noisy clean dataset adding different percentages new relations evaluate effectiveness robustness proposed model. Besides, also evaluate proposed model supervised learning, few-shot learning zero-shot learning scenarios results show proposed model outperforms existing models three scenarios.

Section Methodology describes proposed ZSLRE model. Section Experiments presents experiments compares performance model different models two public datasets. Section Conclusion Future Work includes discussion conclusion promising future work. We proposed multi-source embedding model, MW2V, aimed dealing general language variations. Each slice obtained sources represent time, geography, field, among dimensions. To demonstrate feasibility, applied MW2V three newspaper datasets: The New York Times The Guardian study temporal variations, combination datasets model cultural variations. We performed exhaustive evaluation method text analysis tasks finding good quantitative qualitative results compared state art, even temporal case, MW2V specifically model time direction. Future work includes analysis applications, oriented exploitation datasets, also possible implications use regularization parameter dependent slices words, instead constant one. Moreover, insight needed answer open questions raised proposal, namely, try broader scope languages evaluate robustness."," Most existing supervised and few-shot learning relation extraction methods have relied on labeled training data. However, in real-world scenarios, there exist many relations for which there is no available training data. We address this issue from the perspective of zero-shot learning  which is similar to the way humans learn and recognize new concepts with no prior knowledge. We propose a zero-shot learning relation extraction  framework, which focuses on recognizing novel relations that have no corresponding labeled data available for training. Our proposed ZSLRE model aims to recognize new relations based on prototypical networks that are modified to utilize side  information. The additional use of side information allows those modified prototype networks to recognize novel relations in addition to recognized previously known relations. We construct side information from labels and their synonyms, hypernyms of name entities, and keywords. We build an automatic hypernym extraction framework to help get hypernyms of various name entities directly from web. We demonstrate using extensive experiments on two public datasets  that our proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on supervised learning, few-shot learning and zero-shot learning tasks. Our experimental results also demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed model in a combination scenario. Once accepted for publication, we will publish ZSLRE's source code and datasets to enable reproducibility and encourage further research."

On the other hand, traditional machine translation has a long history of leveraging unlabeled data through noisy channel modeling.  The same idea has recently been shown to achieve strong improvements for neural machine translation. Unfortunately, na\""{i}ve noisy channel modeling with modern sequence to sequence models is up to an order of magnitude slower than alternatives.  We address this issue by introducing efficient approximations to make inference with the noisy channel approach as fast as strong ensembles while increasing accuracy. We also show that the noisy channel approach can outperform strong pre-training results by achieving a new state of the art on WMT Romanian-English translation."
"% Sentiment analysis text classification technique analyses given text returns nature underlying opinion. Therefore, sentiment analysis widely used tasks brand monitoring, political research analysis, product analysis, workforce analysis many more. Sentiment analysis techniques could fundamentally sub divided two categories lexicon-based approach machine learning based approach. Recently introduced deep learning based sentiment analysis techniques outperformed lexicon based approaches traditional machine learning approaches. With development deep learning techniques Convolutional Neural Networks , Recurrent Neural Networks language independent features, domain sentiment analysis reported impressive results. Over years, many variants combinations deep learning techniques feature representations used high resourced languages English. There also exist certain advancements sentiment analysis languages Chinese, Arabic, Spanish Indic languages. Sinhala, morphologically rich Indo-Aryan language, experienced advancements due insular under-resourced nature. One main challenges large enough annotated corpora.

Our experiments show noisy channel modeling outperform pre-training approaches able better exploit wider beams. Moreover, achieved using smaller amount monolingual data. \clearpage"," Due to the high impact of the fast-evolving fields of machine learning and deep learning, Natural Language Processing  tasks have further obtained comprehensive performances for highly resourced languages such as English and Chinese. However Sinhala, which is an under-resourced language with a rich morphology, has not experienced these advancements. For sentiment analysis, there exists only two previous research with deep learning approaches, which focused only on document-level sentiment analysis for the binary case. They experimented with only three types of deep learning models. In contrast, this paper presents a much comprehensive study on the use of standard sequence models such as RNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, as well as more recent state-of-the-art models such as  hierarchical attention hybrid neural networks, and capsule networks. Classification is done at document-level but with more granularity by considering POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL, and CONFLICT classes. A data set of 15059 Sinhala news comments, annotated with these four classes and a corpus consists of 9.48 million tokens are publicly released. This is the largest sentiment annotated data set for Sinhala so far.   % In addition to that,  was extracted from both comments and articles of online newspapers. %Furthermore, the language-independent features such as Word2Vec and fastText were experimented for novel deep learning techniques which clearly indicate the importance of word embedding techniques for NLP tasks including sentiment analysis for Sinhala as a low resource language. % Due to the high impact of the fast-evolving field of machine learning and deep learning, the Natural Language Processing  tasks have further obtained comprehensive and prominent performances over the past few decades. Different variations and combinations of deep learning techniques have been employed for NLP tasks in general. These experiments illustrated highly improved performances with respect to the traditional rule-based and statistical machine learning techniques. These advancements were mainly impacted towards the development of popular languages such as English and Chinese. However, Sinhala which is an under-resourced language with rich morphology, have not experienced these advancements due to fewer resources for NLP tasks. For sentiment analysis, there exist only two previous research with deep learning approaches, which also conducted with less granularity while giving sub optimality with respect to recent advancements in deep learning techniques. In this paper, we present the use of state-of-the-art deep learning approaches such as RNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, Hierarchical Attention Hybrid Neural Networks, and capsule networks for multi-class sentiment analysis for Sinhala news comments while considering more granularity. Under this research, we present the multi-class annotated data set which consists of Sinhala news comments extracted from online newspapers. Furthermore, the language-independent features such as word2Vec and fastText were experimented for novel deep learning techniques which clearly indicates the importance of word embedding techniques for NLP tasks including sentiment analysis."

For many language pairs though, amount and/or quality parallel data enough train NMT model whose accuracy reach acceptable standard . This category language pairs known low resource. Many works explored use easier-to-get monolingual data improve quality translation models category languages -- even high resource languages -- . The back-translation far one successful methods , involving use translations target language monolingual data increase amount training data .

In low resource conditions, available parallel data may able train standard backward model quality additional data generated using model may hurt quality final model. Despite this, aim standard back-translation always improve performance target NMT model providing sufficient training data. Some previous works proposed various methods improve performance backward model training. These methods include iterative back-translation , transfer learning , self-training training bi-directional translation model backward forward translations . Others tried mask deficiencies backward model either inference generating multiple translations target sentence using sampling average-out errors individual translations noising output beam search ; reducing effects errors synthetic data training forward model methods tagged back-translation pre-training fine-tuning . We present hybrid approach utilizes monolingual target data improve forward backward models back-translation. In approach, used synthetic data enhance backward model self-learning standard back-translation improving forward model. The approach preliminary investigated shown achieve positive results. Earlier use stand-alone self-training machine translation proposed extra methods either using quality estimation freezing decoder weights training synthetic side training data. It suggested mistakes synthetic data hurt performance self-trained model . Instead, showed self-training capable improving quality backward model even without using either specialized approaches. It shown using synthetic data generated backward model help re-training backward model improved performance. The work, though, show benefits otherwise using specialized approach cleaning data, especially low resource languages. It also investigate model continue learn output iterating self-learning process. \end{table} This work, therefore, investigates effects synthetic data cleaning using automatic quality estimation training backward model. We observed approach may improve backward model, selecting subset synthetic data may result superior less generic model. We investigated use iterative self-training quality estimation proposed , enabling backward model trained monolingual data. For low resource languages, readily available quality estimation systems data train systems may available. This may limit implementation approach. We, therefore, proposed novel iterative approach relies available monolingual target data improve backward model finally generating much improved synthetic data forward model's training. Experimental results show approach superior standard back-translation approach proposed ; iterative approach superior iterative back-translation also requiring less number models trained.

For experiments conducted identify effect punctuation marks dimension word embeddings towards sentiment analysis task, different preprocessing techniques, word embedding models, several neural network setups used. For experiments, data-set splitted train validation sets, ratio . First, different preprocessing techniques evaluated multi-level sentiment analysis task Sinhala language baseline models. For that, analysis conducted punctuation marks, without punctuation marks without punctuation marks except question mark.

Therefore, The word embedding model fastText, dimension size 300 fixed succeeding experiments. The experiments conducted different baseline models identify best models improvements suggested BiLSTM optimal architecture primary baseline. As per results Table 10-fold cross validation, BiLSTM achieved best weighted accuracy 63.81\ weighted F1 score 57.71\ , beating Vanilla RNN, LSTM, GRU. Therefore LSTM BiLSTM selected improvements. After that, two strategies followed improve selected approaches. First strategy combining CNN baseline models. Even though expected increase weighted accuracy F1 score sentiment analysis process following improved model architecture based CNN, results suggest noticeable enhancement. One reason might enough data learn trainable parameters complex model due CNN integration. Results models listed Table along results improvements baseline models.

As per results Table 10-fold cross validation, 'Stacked BiLSTM 3' model reached weighted accuracy 63.13\ weighted F1 socre 59.42\ outperforming approaches. This could justified ability stacked BiLSTM capture context level information left right direction considering substantial amount neural representation language modeling based stacking strategy. The capsule-B architecture went beyond experimented models producing weighted accuracy 63.23\ weighted F1-score 59.11\ 10-fold cross validation. This observation could elaborated based motivation behind capsule strategy represent neural architecture based vectors improve language representation considering exact order pose information. Furthermore, capsule-B outperformed capsule-A due sophisticated architecture designed capture n-grams features compared capsule-A. The HAHNN illustrate greater performance expected. This could due shorter length comments learn deeper neural representation attention mechanism. also employed HAHNN. The weighted accuracy experiment bounded value 65\ per inter-annotator agreement value. This direct result high volume noise dataset. As illustrated Table, CONFLICT NEUTRAL classes seem considerably mis-classified NEGATIVE comments, due impact large number NEGATIVE comments respect number CONFLICT NEUTRAL comments training set. Figure shows comments model confused classifying. The first example illustrates comment negatively classified truly CONFLICT comment. When considering interpretation comment, sentence includes two negative sentences positive sentence, indicates bias towards NEGATIVE sentiment.

Many works have explored using the readily available monolingual data in either or both of the languages to improve the standard of translation models in low, and even high, resource languages. One of the most successful of such works is the back-translation that utilizes the translations of the target language monolingual data to increase the amount of the training data. The quality of the backward model which is trained on the available parallel data has been shown to determine the performance of the back-translation approach. Despite this, only the forward model is improved on the monolingual target data in standard back-translation. A previous study proposed an iterative back-translation approach for improving both models over several iterations. But unlike in the traditional back-translation, it relied on both the target and source monolingual data. This work, therefore, proposes a novel approach that enables both the backward and forward models to benefit from the monolingual target data through a hybrid of self-learning and back-translation respectively. Experimental results have shown the superiority of the proposed approach over the traditional back-translation method on English-German low resource neural machine translation. We also proposed an iterative self-learning approach that outperforms the iterative back-translation while also relying only on the monolingual target data and require the training of less models."
"End-to-end techniques automatic speech recognition , notably sequence-to-sequence models attention Recurrent Neural Network Transducer , becoming increasingly popular. Compared traditional hybrid system based Hidden Markov Model Deep Neural Network individually-trained components, parts end-to-end model optimized jointly, often leads better performance recognition tasks sufficient training data low training-testing mismatch. End-to-end systems simpler train; typically require pronunciation lexicons, decision trees, initial bootstrapping, forced alignment. End-to-end models also suitable on-device use cases due lack external language models decoding graphs, whose sizes prohibitively large hybrid setups large vocabulary support, complex LMs, context-dependent decision trees. End-to-end systems limitations, however. Their end-to-end nature leads lack composability, acoustic, language, pronunciation models hybrid setups. This lack composability turn leads challenges personalization, traditionally involves on-the-fly modification external LMs add, boost, penalize certain words phrases. Previous work end-to-end ASR addressed issue incorporating external LMs beam search , special modifications handle model's spiky output . A fundamental limitation shallow fusion relies late combination, hence model needs potential produce correct output first place without access biasing information. Another class method adds attention-based simple biasing module contextual phrases provide additional signal decoder component end-to-end models. While promising, methods shown problems scaling large highly confusable biasing lists. A closely related challenge ASR personalization entity recognition, since many cases biasing items entity names. Rare name recognition presents significant challenges end-to-end models two main reasons. First, output units end-to-end models typically graphemes WordPieces , work well spelling word correspond pronounced . Second, rare names often decompose target sequences seen enough training, making difficult recognize correctly. By contrast, problems alleviated hybrid systems due use phonetic lexicons and/or clustered context-dependent acoustic targets. Popular solutions problem include upsampling entity-heavy data generating synthetic training data names using text-to-speech . While method alleviates data sparsity issue, address underlying problems under-trained targets unconventional spelling rare names. In work, propose several novel techniques address challenges improve RNN-T personalization. To alleviate problem under-trained targets recognition unconventional names, adopt on-the-fly sub-word regularization increase WordPiece coverage training, perform pre-training multi-task learning strengthen encoder, leverage grapheme-to-grapheme generate alternative graphemic pronunciations names. To address limitation shallow fusion relying late combination, introduce deep personalized LM fusion influence model's predictions earlier. We show combination techniques results 15.4\%--34.5\% relative Word Error Rate improvement top strong RNN-T baseline leverages shallow fusion TTS augmentation. Our final model also competitive hybrid system significantly larger disk memory footprint. Neural machine translation systems relies huge amount parallel data train standard, state-of-the-art translation models. For low resource languages, models perform woefully deployed. Back-translation approach introduced NMT enable generation additional data improving translation low high resource languages. Subsequent studies shown approach require special methods reach acceptable standard translation quality especially low resource set-ups . In set-ups, backward model trained scarce data and, therefore, quality generated additional data may enough substantially improve target translation model.

The work evaluated low resource IWSLT'14 English-German neural machine translation. We observed even though proposed self-trained backward method outperformed standard back-translation's backward model without using quality estimation freezing parameters decoder proposed respectively, selecting using best synthetic data self-training improves performance. This shows although improved performance achieved, full potential proposed method may realized using vanilla self-training noise synthetic data degrade decoder's performance. We extended positive results obtained using self-learning determining benefit otherwise selecting fraction synthetic data self-training using quality estimation system. Experimental results indicated result affected reduction training data, performance improved significantly, achieving +2.35 BLEU.

It also first work combines quality estimation self-learning improve low resource back-translation NMT. This category languages shown straggle high resource counterparts even methods applied improve quality. The back-translation approach shown tremendous potential improving translation performance high resource languages, shown improved less desirable performance low resource languages. This shown result lack quality backward model. In work, applied joint backward forward translation utilize monolingual data target language train better neural machine translation systems especially low resource languages. We proposed variety techniques implementing approach based availability otherwise another supporting system -- quality estimation system. The self-learning used improve performance backward model. Experimental results obtained low resource English-German shown approach superior widely successful back-translation approach. The approach straightforward also easy implement low resource language translation train better model capable attaining acceptable standard translation. We showed approach capable enhancing standard model even without using specialized quality estimation data selection method. We also showed backward model able differentiate synthetic authentic data, quality gets better. As shown training forward models, also true models trained synthetic authentic data. The self-training approach shown perform better quality estimation used extract best translations used retrain generating backward model. We also extended self-training approach determine whether approach continue benefit backward model several iterations. We presented simplified iterative approach reduces number models required time taken achieve number iterations previous works. We showed possible rely large amounts synthetic data gets improved iteratively especially low resource conditions strictly relying quality fewer training data. Our work relies target monolingual data required traditional back-translation approach unlike target source monolingual data iterative back-translation approach. We showed approach works well low resource neural machine translation. For future work, aim determine appropriate sentences considered fit self-learning iteration especially using data selection alternative quality estimation. We also intend apply approach high resource languages.

However, these models are more challenging to personalize compared to traditional hybrid systems due to the lack of external language models and difficulties in recognizing rare long-tail words, specifically entity names. In this work, we present novel techniques to improve RNN-T's ability to model rare WordPieces, infuse extra information into the encoder, enable the use of alternative graphemic pronunciations, and perform deep fusion with personalized language models for more robust biasing. We show that these combined techniques result in 15.4\%--34.5\% relative Word Error Rate improvement compared to a strong RNN-T baseline which uses shallow fusion and text-to-speech augmentation. Our work helps push the boundary of RNN-T personalization and close the gap with hybrid systems on use cases where biasing and entity recognition are crucial."
"Our goal improve information extraction business documents contribute field automated document processing. This work leads higher success metric enables less manual work regarding data entry and/or annotation industry. To put work context define terms closely let's briefly recall definition task, motivation add details. \paragraph{Information extraction task} The general problem information extraction new problem . A survey information extraction methods defines task as: ``Information Extraction starts collection texts, transforms information readily digested analyzed. It isolates relevant text fragments, extracts relevant information fragments, pieces together targeted information coherent framework''. The relevant collection texts study texts business documents invoices, pro forma invoices debit notes. The targeted information classification texts helps automating various business processes 閳 automated payment invoices. \paragraph{Motivation} The typical user method would company medium-sized bigger because, point, companies start spend significant time document processing. Details harder find referenced peer-reviewed works since companies keep spending information secret. Approximations unofficial sources lead estimate success metric translates company savings. A typical medium-sized company approximately invoices per month even improvement roughly translates dollars saving monthly scales company size. Note heuristics thus define metric exactly. \paragraph{Details overview} As stated, focus business documents. The explicit category documents varies. Existing works information extraction define ``visually rich documents'', ``structured'', ``semi-structured''. We use name ``structured documents'' throughout work since structure documents clear understandable human working relevant fields, even though specific structure varies. Moreover, documents machine-readable detail individual words pictures page, machine, ``understandable'' respect goal important information extraction. It important classify information needed financial/accounting industry, ``users'' documents. For example, payment details, amount paid, issuer information etc. The input document's page goal identify output words entities document considered important, along respective classifications. One example input invoice output extraction seen \prettyref{fig:Example}. As see, documents easily understandable inputs. An example trivial inputs would XML document desired target classes incorporated machine-readable way. With study, aim expand previous work , already shown neural networks succeed task extracting important information even identifying whole, highly specific tables. As argued before, every improvement matters work, focus improving metrics selecting relevant techniques deep learning field. A classical heuristic way generally improve target metric provide relevant information network. Previously exhausted information present single invoice focus techniques related ``similarity''. Existing works similarity presented \prettyref{subsec:Inspiration} use notion similarity defined \prettyref{subsec:The-learning-framework}. In short, present similar annotated document another input. More details differences previous work described \prettyref{subsec:The-differences-to-prev}. Since idea providing information fundamental even simpler templating techniques , need stress that, due nature dataset , problem cannot solved using templates. To prove statement, reasonable template-based baseline presented evaluated . The research question focus ``similarity'' based mechanism various model implementations, whether improve existing solution . The hypothesis able create least one model significantly improve results. Moreover, since presented mechanism theoretically applicable beyond scope document processing, work contribute broader audience. Ultimately present model source code outperforms previous state-of-art results. An anonymized version dataset also included open-source resource notable contribution since size greater similar dataset known date. \subsection{Related works} This subsection focuses research previous works approaches relevant field information extraction. The text subsection heavily based text . The plethora methods used historically general information extraction hard fully summarize compare. Moreover, would fair compare methods developed evaluated fundamentally different datasets. However, assessed none methods well-suited working structured documents , since generally fixed layout, language, caption set, delimiters, fonts... For example, invoices vary countries, companies departments, change time. In order retrieve information structured document, must understand it. Our criterion considering method compare human-controlled preprocessing template specification layout fixing required aim fully automated general solution. Therefore including historical method baseline compare against. In recent works, significant number successfully use graph representation document use graph neural networks. Also, key idea close one-shot principle information extraction used examined example . Both works use notions finding similar documents reusing gold-standards . The latter applies principle form template matching without need learnable parameters. Our approach also called ``word classification'' approach written , work end-to-end architecture concept memory explored. At point, important clarify differences works stream research . The important difference comes dataset disposal. The dataset explored far greater datasets used elsewhere, allows exploring deeper models opposed using graph neural networks. Indeed previous paper, proven graph neural networks work synergy additional convolution-over-sequence layers even global self-attention. For clarity, roles said layers described \prettyref{subsec:Common-architecture}. Moreover, dataset quality allowed us discover information extraction line-item table detection targets boost other. As research focused deeper models, using works baselines commonly used graph neural networks incorporated one layer amidst many, special focus. In following pages, explore models would able benefit access known similar document's page. We hope model exploit similarities documents, even similar templates. \subsection{Broader inspiration} A broader section references provided since using great variety layers exploration deep network architectures. \paragraph{One-shot learning similarity} Presented model design concept aims improve models new data without retraining network. Typically, classification model trained recognize specific set classes. In one-shot learning, usually able correctly identify classes comparing already known data. Unlike traditional multi-class classification, one-shot learning allows us attain better scores even surprisingly low numbers samples . Sometimes work even classes present training set . This concept help areas ranging computer vision variants 閳 omniglot challenge object detection , finding similar images , face detection , autonomous vision , speech also NLP area . Among methods make one-shot learning able work, fundamental one utilizes concept similarity. For similarity work, two types data 閳 ``unknown'' ``known''. For known data, target values known method and/or model. To classify unknown input, usual practice assign class class similar known input. Technically speaking, architecture contains 閳ユ笩iamese閳 part. In particular, inputs passed network architecture tied weights. We draw inspiration basic principle, leave advanced methods one-shot learning research. Usually due performance reasons model asked compare new inputs every known input 閳 subset. Therefore, prior pruning technique needs incorporated 閳 example form nearest neighbor search embedding space, done example work . Another option would incorporate memory concept . The loss used similarity learning called triplet loss applied triplet classes data-point: Where margin positive negative classes model function mapping inputs embedding space . Generally speaking, one-shot learning classified meta-learning technique. For meta-learning, suggest recent study, like . Taking concept one step yields concept called ``zero-shot learning'' . \paragraph{Other sources inspiration} It beneficial mention sources inspiration also meaningfully close one-shot learning. Since ask ``what labels similar new data'', ``query answer'' approach considered. Recently, attention principle successfully helped pave way language models . It uncommon use attention one-shot approaches also query answer problems various problems domains . The mentioned task similarity also approached pairwise classification, even dissimilarity . Deep context weights bias phrases In paper, showed RNN-T personalization improved significantly inducing better coverage rare WordPieces training, introducing extra information encoder, leveraging G2G produce additional pronunciation variants training decoding, biasing earlier deep PLM fusion. Together, techniques help push boundary RNN-T personalization close gap traditional hybrid systems use cases require contextual biasing accurate name recognition. For future work, plan incorporate proper WFST NNLM deep PLM fusion, apply techniques end-to-end models, tackle open-domain personalization strong context prefixes always available."," The automation of document processing is gaining recent attention due to the great potential to reduce manual work through improved methods and hardware. Any improvement of information extraction systems or further reduction in their error rates has a significant impact in the real world for any company working with business documents as lowering the reliability on cost-heavy and error-prone human work significantly improves the revenue. In this area, neural networks have been applied before 闁 even though they have been trained only on relatively small datasets with hundreds of documents so far.  To successfully explore deep learning techniques and improve the information extraction results, a dataset with more than twenty-five thousand documents has been compiled, anonymized and is published as a part of this work. We will expand our previous work where we proved that convolutions, graph convolutions and self-attention can work together and exploit all the information present in a structured document. Taking the fully trainable method one step further, we will now design and examine various approaches to using siamese networks, concepts of similarity, one-shot learning and context/memory awareness. The aim is to improve micro $F_{1}$ of per-word classification on the huge real-world document dataset.  The results verify the hypothesis that trainable access to a similar  page together with its already known target information improves the information extraction. Furthermore, the experiments confirm that all proposed architecture parts  are all required to beat the previous results.  The best model improves the previous state-of-the-art results by an $8.25\,\%$ gain in $F_{1}$ score. Qualitative analysis is provided to verify that the new model performs better for all target classes. Additionally, multiple structural observations about the causes of the underperformance of some architectures are revealed.  All the source codes, parameters and implementation details are published together with the dataset in the hope to push the research boundaries since all the techniques used in this work are not problem-specific and can be generalized for other tasks and contexts.   \keywords{one-shot learning \and information extraction \and siamese networks \and  similarity \and attention}"

To facilitate future work, make models, code, data available ."," The goal of semi-supervised learning is to utilize the unlabeled, in-domain dataset $U$ to improve models trained on the labeled dataset $D$.     Under the context of   large-scale language-model  pretraining,   how we  can make the best use of   $U$   is poorly understood:   Is semi-supervised learning still beneficial   with the presence of  large-scale pretraining?  Should $U$ be used for in-domain LM pretraining or pseudo-label generation? How should the pseudo-label based semi-supervised model    be actually implemented? How different semi-supervised strategies  affect performances regarding $D$ of different sizes, $U$ of different sizes, etc.   In this paper, we conduct comprehensive studies  on  semi-supervised learning in the  task of text classification   under the context of  large-scale LM pretraining. Our studies shed important  lights on the  behavior of semi-supervised learning methods.   We find that:    with the presence of  in-domain LM pretraining  on $U$, open-domain LM pretraining \cite{devlin2018bert}  is unnecessary, and we are able to achieve better performance with pretraining on  the in-domain dataset $U$;  both the in-domain pretraining strategy and the pseudo-label based strategy introduce  significant performance boosts,  with the former performing better with larger $U$,  the latter performing better with smaller $U$, and the combination leading to the largest performance gain;   vanilla self-training  yields better performances when $D$ is small, while joint training on the combination of  $D'$ and $D$ yields better performances when $D$ is large.   %We use the task of text classification as an example,  the method of which can be easily adapted to different NLP tasks.  Using semi-supervised learning strategies, we are able to achieve a performance of around $93.8\%$ accuracy with only 50 training data points on the IMDB dataset, and   a competitive performance of 96.6$\%$ with the full  IMDB dataset.  Our work marks an initial step toward understanding the behavior of semi-supervised learning models under the context of large-scale pretraining.\footnote{Code, models and datasets  can be found at https://github.com/ShannonAI/Neural-Semi-Supervised-Learning-for-Text-Classification}"

"In section, mention different tokenization techniques SLT explain perspective problem. We mentioned basics SLT NMT. From research perspective, NMT methods provide successful results good tokens SL vides. Therefore, tokenization seen crucial part research. Firstly, visual properties involved tokenization part. Secondly, generic approach obtain strong tokens SLs. In addition that, clear discrete tokens obtained better translation quality. For reason, extend meaning tokenization NSLT covers overall process prepare frames NMT module. \par For spoken spoken languages, generally use words tokens feed NMT module. The current state-of-the-art method converts tokens continuous embeddings reach semantic representation. While learning translation, word embedding also trained learn relationship words. Eventually, meaningful embedding obtained NMT module seen Figure . Based this, may good idea learn good representation signs replace word embeddings achieve advancements NSLT NMT done. This representation cross-lingual; learning open problem. Our research mainly focused problem. Before introducing approach, discuss existing three tokenization approaches following subsection. \subsection{Input Tokenization NSLT} \par The first approach using glosses tokens. Glosses intermediate word-like representations signs words sentences. Therefore, directly applicable NMT framework without effort. However, certain shortcomings method. Firstly, glosses rarely exist real life. Gloss annotation requires laborious process special expertise. Secondly, glosses unique SLs. Therefore, SL requires special effort obtain glosses whereas sentences commonly available. The last drawback mistake gloss level produce dramatic meaning differences translation, since glosses high level annotations, similar words. \par The second approach first one terms tokens. On top that, approach learns extract glosses frames. In words, method uses glosses explicit intermediate representations seen Figure . It eliminates search tokenization, needs special network frame gloss conversion. There two main concerns. The first one network frame gloss conversion still dependent gloss annotations. The second clear glosses upper bound SLT sufficient evidence. The problem immature result provides clues whether glosses may restrict translation quality. The third approach called frame-level tokenization. This approach establish explicit intermediate representation seen Figure . It aims learn good sign embeddings replace word-embeddings. However, golden way represent signs embeddings feed NMT module. Furthermore, clear length embedding be. Embeddings obtained frame extracted inner short clips video. In addition that, representation learned sentence-video pairs trained outside NSLT system. There several ways frame-level tokenization. However, main difference gloss level tokenization discrete representation eliminated. If find proper one, would several advantages. The first one resulting framework applied SL translation task without requiring annotation. The second advantage opportunity inject additional supervision. The representations would trained different tasks different datasets whereas gloss level tokenization cannot cover different SLs. The third one token length adjusted.

The tokenization part focuses on how Sign Language  videos should be represented to be fed into the other part. It has not been studied elaborately whereas NMT research has attracted several researchers contributing enormous advancements. Up to now, there are two main input tokenization levels, namely frame-level and gloss-level tokenization. Glosses are world-like intermediate presentation and unique to SLs. Therefore, we aim to develop a generic sign-level tokenization layer so that it is applicable to other domains without further effort. \par We begin with investigating current tokenization approaches and explain their weaknesses with several experiments. To provide a solution, we adapt Transfer Learning, Multitask Learning and Unsupervised Domain Adaptation into this research to leverage additional supervision. We succeed in enabling knowledge transfer between SLs and improve translation quality by 5 points in BLEU-4 and 8 points in ROUGE scores. Secondly, we show the effects of body parts by extensive experiments in all the tokenization approaches. Apart from these, we adopt  3D-CNNs to improve efficiency in terms of time and space. Lastly, we discuss the advantages of sign-level tokenization over gloss-level tokenization. To sum up, our proposed method eliminates the need for gloss level annotation to obtain higher scores by providing additional supervision by utilizing weak supervision sources."

However, much of the research on automatic storytelling generation assumes that stories will be generated by an agent without any human interaction. In this paper, we introduce the task of collaborative storytelling, where an artificial intelligence agent and a person collaborate to create a unique story by taking turns adding to it. We present a collaborative storytelling system which works with a human storyteller to create a story by generating new utterances based on the story so far. We constructed the storytelling system by tuning a publicly-available large scale language model on a dataset of writing prompts and their accompanying fictional works. We identify generating sufficiently human-like utterances to be an important technical issue and propose a sample-and-rank approach to improve utterance quality. Quantitative evaluation shows that our approach outperforms a baseline, and we present  qualitative evaluation of our system's capabilities."
"The vast amounts scientific literature provide significant source information biomedical research. Using literature identify relations entities important task various applications . Existing approaches biomedical relation extraction usually fall one two categories. Mention-level extraction aims classify relation pair entities within short span text . In contrast, pair-level extraction aims classify relation pair entities across entire paragraph, document corpus. For mention-level pair-level relation extraction, recent work focused representation learning. This considered one major steps towards making progress artificial intelligence . Representations relations understand context particularly important biomedical research, identifying fruitful targets crucial due high costs experimentation. Learning representations likely require large amounts unsupervised data due scarcity labelled data domain. Recent mention-level methods based using large unsupervised models Transformer networks learn representations sentences containing pairs entities. These representations used inputs much smaller models, perform supervised relation classification . Recent pair-level methods based encoding mention pair entities, designing mechanism pool encodings single representation. This representation used classify relation entity pair . However, representation learning methods mention-level pair-level extraction typically use point estimate representation. As result, may struggle capture nature true, potentially complex relations pair entities. For example, Figure shows sentences two entity pairs demonstrate relation statements different, typically depending biological circumstances . Such nuanced relations difficult capture single point estimate. We hypothesise true underlying relation entity pair, relation multimodal . The sentences containing pair textual observations underlying relations. We therefore propose probabilistic model uses continuous latent variable represent true relation entity pair. The distribution sentence containing pair conditioned latent variable. In order able model complex relations entity pair, use infinite mixture distribution latent representation. Our model provides unified architecture learning representations relations entity pairs mention pair level. We show posterior distribution latent variable used mention-level relation classification.

Existing approaches usually focus on identifying a relation either in a single sentence  or across an entire corpus . In both cases, recent methods have achieved strong results by learning a point estimate to represent the relation; this is then used as the input to a relation classifier. However, the relation expressed in text between a pair of biomedical entities is often more complex than can be captured by a point estimate. To address this issue, we propose a latent variable model with an arbitrarily flexible distribution to represent the relation between an entity pair. Additionally, our model provides a unified architecture for both mention-level and pair-level relation extraction. We demonstrate that our model achieves results competitive with strong baselines for both tasks while having fewer parameters and being significantly faster to train.

"% A long desired goal AI systems play important collaborative role everyday lives. Currently, predominant approach visual question answering relies encoding image question black-box transformer encoder.

Despite this approach's strong quantitative results, it struggles to come up with intuitive, human-readable forms of justification for the prediction process. To address this insufficiency, we reformulate VQA as a full answer generation task, which requires the model to justify its predictions in natural language. We propose LRTA [Look, Read, Think, Answer], a transparent neural-symbolic reasoning framework for visual question answering that solves the problem step-by-step like humans and provides human-readable form of justification at each step. Specifically, LRTA learns to first convert an image into a scene graph and parse a question into multiple reasoning instructions. It then executes the reasoning instructions one at a time by traversing the scene graph using a recurrent neural-symbolic execution module. Finally, it generates a full answer to the given question with natural language justifications. Our experiments on GQA dataset show that LRTA outperforms the state-of-the-art model by a large margin  on the full answer generation task. We also create a perturbed GQA test set by removing linguistic cues  in the questions for analyzing whether a model is having a smart guess with superficial data correlations. We show that LRTA makes a step towards truly understanding the question while the state-of-the-art model tends to learn superficial correlations from the training data."

Lastly, in terms of evaluation, we suggest a `robust' accuracy measurement by modifying that of \cite{trichelair:2018}. As with their switching method, we evaluate a model by considering its performance on trivial variants of each sentence in the test set."
"% overview + widespread applications Text classification, extensively applied fundamental cornerstone natural language processing applications, sentiment analysis, spam detection spoken dialogue systems, widely studied decades. In general, almost NLP tasks cast classification problems either document, sentence, word level. Here focusing means narrow sense, i.e., given sequence tokens arbitrary length, predicting likely categorization belongs to. % conventional approaches, CNN/LSTM pros, + cons: lack efficacy capture latent representations. Considerable compelling neural approaches text classification task empirically demonstrated remarkable behaviors recent years, orchestrate compose semantic syntactic representations texts central. Much work concentrated learning composition distributional word representations categorization, wherein plenty deep learning methods adopted, TextCNNs, RCNNs, recurrent neural networks , FastText, BERT, etc. Most learn word representations firstly projecting one-hot encoding token pretrained randomly initialized word embedding matrices acquire dense real-valued vectors, feed neural models classification. These methods, however, exploited low-dimensional semantic representations sample text supervised way. Some argued unsupervised latent representations topic cluster modeling mined latent variable models may benefit. maintained word clustering could deliver useful semantic information grouping words corpus thus promote classification accuracy. Moreover, incorporated neural topic models Variational Autoencoder classification tasks discover latent topics document level encode co-occurrence words bag-of-words statistics. Learning corpus-level representation administer enrichment globally informative features thus favorable task performance. There plenty works adopting VAE learning latent variables boost text classification performance. Nevertheless, remain problems cannot directly treat sampled latent space VAE clustering centroids since mechanism modulate representation different samples towards different mean variance better discrimination purpose Gaussian distribution assumption. alleviate issues minimizing distance learnable latent representation latent variable models clustering centers generated statistical clustering approaches. % trained with, projecting word indices dense word representations.

Instead directly treating latent variables clustering centroids, employ co-adaptation strategy minimize difference hidden variables trainable clustering centroids initialized traditional clustering algorithms soft alignments. In present work, propose cluster-token alignment mechanism assigning relevance probability distribution clusters token, indicating likely tokens correlated cluster center.

We extend the neural text clustering approach to text classification tasks by inducing cluster centers via a latent variable model and interacting with distributional word embeddings, to enrich the representation of tokens and measure the relatedness between tokens and each learnable cluster centroid. The proposed method jointly learns word clustering centroids and clustering-token alignments, achieving the state of the art results on multiple benchmark datasets and proving that the proposed cluster-token alignment mechanism is indeed favorable to text classification. Notably, our qualitative analysis has conspicuously illustrated that text representations learned by the proposed model are in accord well with our intuition."
"Past work found variability speech signals often poorly modeled, despite recent advances speech representation learning using deep neural networks . An important source acoustic variability comes accent information embedded speech signals . Non-native accents frequently observed second language spoken, mainly caused first language background non-native speakers. The accent strength non-native speaker dependent amount transfer native language, generally influenced variety variables age second-language learning one valuable predictors . However, accent variability often overlooked modeling language, consequently high-resource languages English often treated homogeneous . That assumption problematic is, example, shown comparing number native non-native speakers English, latter group almost twice large former group . It therefore important accurately model pronunciation variation using representations speech allow variability incorporated. Traditionally, pronunciations often represented evaluated phonetically transcribing speech . However, transcribing speech using phonetic alphabet time consuming, labor intensive, interference transcriber variation might lead inconsistencies . Additionally, fine-grained pronunciation differences relevant studying accented speech may captured using set discrete symbols . \citet{acoustic-measure} therefore introduced acoustic-only measure comparing pronunciations. In method, represented accented speech 39-dimensional Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients , used compute acoustic-based non-native-likeness ratings non-native native speakers English. They found strong correlation automatically determined acoustic-based non-native-likeness ratings native-likeness ratings provided human raters . This result close to, still equal performance phonetic transcription-based approach . \citet{acoustic-measure} also conducted several small-scale experiments investigate whether fine-grained characteristics human speech captured compared phonetic transcription-based pronunciation difference measure. Their results showed acoustic-only measure captured segmental differences, intonational differences, durational differences, method invariant characteristics recording device. The quality MFCC representations known dependent presence additive noise . Recent work shown self-supervised representation learning models less affected noise, well-equipped model complex non-linear relationships . For example, models learn meaningful representations basis read English speech without direct supervision. Fine-tuning models using transcribed speech resulted representations resembled phonetic structure, offered significant improvements downstream speech recognition tasks . Consequently, paper, employ self-supervised neural models create automatically determined acoustic-only pronunciation difference measure, investigate whether results improved performance compared MFCC-based approach \citet{acoustic-measure} phonetic transcription-based approach \citet{wieling2014a}. In following, compare evaluate several neural models, namely , \citep[subsequently denoted ]{schneider2019wav2vec}, , \citep[subsequently denoted ]{baevski2019vq}, \citep[subsequently denoted ]{baevski2020wav2vec}. We evaluate performance algorithms using two different datasets. The first identical dataset used \citet{acoustic-measure} \citet{wieling2014a}. The second new dataset focuses accented speech single group non-native speakers human native-likeness judgements also available. For reproducibility, provide code via \url{https://github.com/Bartelds/neural-acoustic-distance}. The performance model assessed comparing obtained neural acoustic-only pronunciation differences phonetic transcription-based pronunciation distances, MFCC-based acoustic-only pronunciation distances, human perception. To understand aspects pronunciation variation neural models capture, conduct several additional small-scale experiments, line \citet{acoustic-measure}. We analysed adding explicit morphological information form embeddings POS tags morphological features two currently dominant neural network architectures used NLP: LSTM networks transformer-based BERT models. We compared models enhanced morphological information baselines three tasks . To obtain general conclusions, used subsets eight morphologically-rich languages different language families. The results indicate adding morphological information NER prediction models beneficial, improves performance NER DP tasks. For DP task, improvement depends quality morphological features. The additional morphological features consistently benefited LSTM-based models NER DP, high quality predicted . For BERT-based models, predicted features make practical difference NER DP task improve performance DP task high quality. Testing different variants BERT shows language specialised variants improve performance DP task additional morphological information beneficial, though less less shift multilingual towards monolingual models. The comparison different BERT variants indicates BERT models completely capture language morphology. Since release BERT, several new pre-training objectives proposed, syntactic semantic phrase masking~ span masking~. In work, makes sense apply models DP task order test well capture morphology. Further, effect morphological features could analysed additional tasks languages, since explicit morphological information seem benefit equally. \subsection*{Acknowledgements} This paper supported European Union閳ユ獨 Horizon 2020 Programme project EMBEDDIA .

To create reliable representations of speech independent from phonetic transcriptions, we investigate the extraction of acoustic embeddings from several self-supervised neural models.  We use these representations to compute word-based pronunciation differences between non-native and native speakers of English, and evaluate these differences by comparing them with human native-likeness judgments.  We show that Transformer-based speech representations lead to significant performance gains over the use of phonetic transcriptions, and find that feature-based use of Transformer models is most effective with one or more middle layers instead of the final layer.  We also demonstrate that these neural speech representations not only capture segmental differences, but also intonational and durational differences that cannot be represented by a set of discrete symbols used in phonetic transcriptions."
"KR\&R systems work well certain knowledge-rich domains typically involve set axioms rules, use structured queries datasets, need precise logical inference explanations. Formal logic-based reasoning engines Cyc Ergo successfully deployed domains legal, healthcare finance.

These issues are particularly severe for the Natural Language Understanding  task, where we often use implicit background knowledge to understand and reason about text, resort to fuzzy alignment of concepts and relations during reasoning, and constantly deal with ambiguity in representations.   To address these issues, we devise a novel FOL-based reasoner, called Braid, that supports probabilistic rules, and uses the notion of custom unification functions and dynamic rule generation to overcome the brittle matching and knowledge-gap problem prevalent in traditional reasoners.

"} {I}{n} past decade, seen emergence various Knowledge Graphs , YAGO DBPedia. They achieved great success academic industrial applications, ranging recommendation Question Answering. However, KGs far complete, limits benefits transferred knowledge. Relation Extraction vital step complete KGs extracting relations entities texts. It nontrivial since relation type may various textual expressions, meanwhile, different types relations also described words. Such ambiguity relations texts challenges supervision RE models. Due expensive human annotation cost, distant supervision proposed automatically annotate mappings sentences relations. It assumes two entities participate relation, a.k.a., triple express another relation . As shown Figure, given triple , collect two sentences include entity pair . Clearly, first sentence expresses similar meaning given relation type, second one implies another type relation city of, brings noise training corpora\footnote{As term relation refer either relation type relation instance , paper, simplify use term relation relation type unless otherwise stated.}. To highlight informative sentences, many existing works introduce attention mechanism assign sentences different learning weights. In terms quantity, hand, training data collected distant supervision concentrate mainly relations, leading issue lack sufficient annotations remaining relations. Take widely used dataset, New York Times , example, present number training instances relation Figure. Unsurprisingly, annotations long-tail concerning different relations, tail relations suffer insufficient training corpora. More specifically, relation refers multiple entity pairs smaller similar respect RE prediction distributions common textual contexts. Therefore, capture relation proximity precise general way remains challenging. Another major challenge distinguish different relations, case knowledge transfer introduces bias towards prediction proximate relations. For example, mentioned above, /location/us\_state/capital /location/fr\_region/capital indicate capital relation, difference two United States entities French entities. DPEN incorporates entity type information learn relation-specific classifier dynamically. However, entity type information sparse KGs , challenging scalability. To address first issue, propose learn relation prototypes capture proximity relationship among relations involved entity pairs. Inspired Prototypical Networks, represent relation prototype centroid training data, data point defined difference pair entity embeddings, namely implicit mutual relation . Given entity pair, compute implicit mutual relation distance relation prototype. These proximities suggest possible relations classifier, makes correct predictions extracting discriminative signals supportive sentences. Relation prototypes also enhanced prior information , applied arbitrary sentence encoder. To address second issue, enhance entity embeddings textual information implicit mutual relation learning. In specific, construct entity co-occurrence graph unlabeled texts modeling first-order second-order structural proximity. The massive textual contexts helpful infer entity types distinguishment. Besides, long-tail entity pairs also benefit additional textual information. We summarize main contributions follows: A preliminary version work published conference ICDE 2020.

The training data mainly concentrates on a few types of relations, leading to the lack of sufficient annotations for the remaining types of relations. In this paper, we propose a general approach to learn relation prototypes from unlabeled texts, to facilitate the long-tail relation extraction by transferring knowledge from the relation types with sufficient training data. We learn relation prototypes as an implicit factor between entities, which reflects the meanings of relations as well as their proximities for transfer learning. Specifically, we construct a co-occurrence graph from texts, and capture both first-order and second-order entity proximities for embedding learning. Based on this, we further optimize the distance from entity pairs to corresponding prototypes, which can be easily adapted to almost arbitrary RE frameworks. Thus, the learning of infrequent or even unseen relation types will benefit from semantically proximate relations through pairs of entities and large-scale textual information.      We have conducted extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets: New York Times and Google Distant Supervision.

They tend to express their intent as a query in natural language to find examples of related code. However performance of such systems are restricted due to 1) limited shared vocabulary across code and user query and 2) lack of semantic understanding of the user query.   % In this work, we evaluate Siamese network for the task of code retrieval. Building on two sub network, our siamese model can jointly learn between code and its description and represent them based on their semantic distance. We evaluate the performance of applying siamese networks 1) as a stand-alone model directly feeding code and its description 2) as a model stacked on existing state of the art models. We experiment on 2 datasets and 3 baseline models, and conclude that applying siamese networking on top of base models yield better embedding and improves the performance of the code sesearch taks significantly.  With the increase in the number of open repositories and discussion forums, the use of natural language for semantic code search has become increasingly common. The accuracy of the results returned by such systems, however, can be low due to 1) limited shared vocabulary between code and user query and 2) inadequate semantic understanding of user query and its relation to code syntax. Siamese networks are well suited to learning such joint relations between data, but have not been explored in the context of code search. In this work, we evaluate Siamese networks for this task by exploring multiple extraction network architectures. These networks independently process code and text descriptions before passing them to a Siamese network to learn embeddings in a common space. We experiment on two different datasets and discover that Siamese networks can act as strong regularizers on networks that extract rich information from code and text, which in turn helps achieve impressive performance on code search beating previous baselines on $2$ programming languages. We also analyze the embedding space of these networks and provide directions to fully leverage the power of Siamese networks for semantic code search."
"We motivated problem labelling dataset word sense disambiguation, want use limited budget collect annotations reasonable number examples sense word. This task thought active learning problem , two nonstandard challenges. First, given word get set candidate labels knowledge base WordNet . However, label set necessarily representative occurs data: may exist labels knowledge base occur corpus sense rare modern English; conversely, may also exist true labels exist knowledge base. For example, consider word ``bass.'' It frequently used noun modifier, e.g., ``the bass alto good singers'', ``I play bass guitar''. It also commonly used refer type fish, music widely discussed online, fish sense word orders magnitude less common low-frequency sound sense internet text. The Oxford dictionary also notes bass referred fibrous material used matting chords, sense common modern English. We want method collects balanced labels common senses, ``bass frequencies'' ``bass fish'', ignores sufficiently rare senses, ``fibrous material''. Second, empirical distribution true labels may exhibit extreme skew: word sense usage often power-law distributed frequent senses occurring orders magnitudes often rare senses. When considered individually, neither constraints incompatible existing active learning approaches: incomplete label sets pose problem method relies classifier uncertainty exploration ; extreme skew label distributions studied guided learning framework wherein annotators asked explicitly search examples rare classes rather simply label examples presented system . But taken together, constraints make standard approaches impractical. Search-based ideas guided learning far sample efficient skewed label distribution, require mechanism annotators search examples correct label set undesirable ask annotators find examples actually occur corpus. Our approach follows. We introduce frequency threshold, , sense deemed ``sufficiently rare'' % ignored = p_y < \thresholdp_y\hat{p}_y$ using importance-weighted samples. Once found examples common classes, switch standard active learning methods find additional examples reduce classifier uncertainty. Overall, paper makes two key contributions.

The restriction compact information 2 dimensions led loss information 2-d embedding space given set queries, led DCS layer learn rich set embeddings. figure show pitch scatter plot correct-wrong pairs points, needed If argument indeed holds, would see gradual loss information look embeddings intermediate layers network, upto final layer. We visualize embeddings layer DCS output final layer using tSNE set queries table X. Indeed, see cluster representing queries embedding space intermediate layer somewhat scattered, much final layer. B. For DCS-Siamese network, retrieval output DCS layer achieves higher MRR We focus actual embeddings learnt different layers DCS-Siamese network . Figure shows embedding plots final Siamese layer output DCS layer . We focus two specific set queries shown Table . We believe output units results much stronger regularization effect leading two sets questions mapped well-defined regions embedding space. As discussed earlier, regularization effect output units results much better embedding DCS layer resulting sets questions mapped well-defined regions embedding space. However, due low dimensionality final layer, tremendous loss information deprives layer meaning representations. The purpose representations simply reduce loss function guide gradient forcing lower layers learn much meaningful embedding. The actual meaning representations code text hence obtained lower layer. This effect also consistent embeddings code, observed Figure , generated plot embeddings SQL queries corresponding questions Table . In comparison, DCS layer embedding DSC-Siamese network , observed one clusters sorting questions . This due fact question involves deletion would more-or-less always translated 'DELETE FROM' clause code . However, could several questions might explicitly ask sorting, still require sorting intermediate step answer. The code corresponding answers would 'ORDER BY' clause, depending actual question, might involve SQL clauses. To summarize, far stronger regularizing effect network compared larger values. However, due effect, seems loss information final layers Siamese network hence, embeddings learned lower layers network contain richer information Code retrieval task. C. The DCS extraction network greatly outperforms extraction networks combined Siamese networks We selected DCS setup extraction network leveraged variety features code. Although believe features collectively responsible impressive performance DCS-Siamese model, considered individually Siamese network, unable provide enough information training, leading extremely poor model. This hints possibility providing code input deep learning network may straightforward although DCS features worked well, possibly features need discovered. Also, code features might useful certain datasets, all. hav explained select find/get/fetch far apart, give solution fix This result surprising since [togther stand paper] reported impressive results using siamese networks simple preprocessing conv-pooling-relu-FC network.

We are motivated by the NLP problem of word sense disambiguation. For any word, we have a set of candidate labels from a knowledge base, but the label set is not necessarily representative of what occurs in the data: there may exist labels in the knowledge base that very rarely occur in the corpus because the sense is rare in modern English; and conversely there may exist true labels that do not exist in our knowledge base. Our aim is to obtain a classifier that performs as well as possible on examples of each 闁炽儲绔穙mmon class闁 that occurs with frequency above a given threshold in the unlabeled set while annotating as few examples as possible from 闁炽儲绗re classes闁 whose labels occur with less than this frequency. The challenge is that we are not informed which labels are common and which are rare, and the true label distribution may exhibit extreme skew. We describe an active learning approach that  explicitly searches for rare classes by leveraging the contextual embedding spaces provided by modern language models, and  incorporates a stopping rule that ignores classes once we prove that they occur below our target threshold with high probability. We prove that our algorithm only costs logarithmically more than a hypothetical approach that knows all true label frequencies and show experimentally that incorporating automated search can significantly reduce the number of samples needed to reach target accuracy levels."
"Argumentation paramount process society, debating socially relevant topics requires high-quality relevant arguments. In work, deal problem argument search, also known argument retrieval. The goal develop \acrfull{arg_ret_sys} organizes arguments, previously extracted various sources , accessible form. Users formulate query access relevant arguments retrieved \acrshort{arg_ret_sys}. The query defined topic, e.g. Energy case \acrshort{arg_ret_sys} retrieves possible arguments without specification. Our work deals advanced case, query formulated form claim, user expects premises attacking supporting query claim. An example claim related topic Energy could ``We abandon Nuclear Energy"" supporting premise, e.g., ``Accidents caused Nuclear Energy longstanding negative impacts"". % A popular search methodology find relevant premises similarity search, representations retrieved premises similar representation query claim. However, noted by, relevance premise necessarily coincide pure text similarity. Therefore, authors advocate utilize similarity query claim claims \acrshort{arg_ret_sys} database retrieve premises assigned similar claims. However, \acrshort{arg_ret_sys} requires ground truth information premise claim assignments therefore limited applicability: Either information sources restricted sources information already available automatically inferred, expensive human annotations required. To mitigate problem keep original system's advantages, propose use machine learning model learn relevance premises claims. Using model, omit claim-claim matching step evaluate importance candidate premises directly query claim. Since relevance defined semantic level, design appropriate training task enable model learn semantic differences relevant non-relevant premises.

Beyond word-sense disambiguation, using EGAL collect multi-word expression data, shares extreme skew property."," In this work, we focus on retrieving relevant arguments for a query claim covering diverse aspects. State-of-the-art methods rely on explicit mappings between claims and premises and thus cannot utilize extensive available collections of premises without laborious and costly manual annotation. Their diversity approach relies on removing duplicates via clustering, which does not directly ensure that the selected premises cover all aspects. This work introduces a new multi-step approach for the argument retrieval problem. Rather than relying on ground-truth assignments, our approach employs a machine learning model to capture semantic relationships between arguments. Beyond that, it aims to cover diverse facets of the query instead of explicitly identifying duplicates.  Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that our approach leads to a significant improvement in the argument retrieval task, even though it requires fewer data than prior methods.

"Speaker diarization process partitioning audio stream homogeneous segments according speaker identities. Thus, diarization determines ``who spoke when'' multi-speaker environment, variety applications conversations involving multiple speakers, meetings, television shows, medical consultations, call center conversations. In particular, speaker boundaries produced diarization system used map transcripts generated multi-speaker automatic speech recognition system speaker-attributed transcripts . Moreover, speaker embeddings inferred diarization help ASR system adapt to, focus speech targeted speaker . Conventional speaker diarization systems based clustering speaker embeddings. In approach, several components integrated single system: speech segments determined voice activity detection ; speech segments divided smaller chunks fixed size; speaker embeddings extracted speaker embedding extractors chunk; finally, speaker embeddings clustered map segment speaker identity . For embeddings, i-vectors , x-vectors , d-vectors commonly used. Clustering methods typically used speaker diarization agglomerative hierarchical clustering , k-means clustering , spectral clustering . Recently, neural network-based clustering explored . Clustering-based speaker diarization achieves good performance several shortcomings. First, relies multiple modules trained separately. Therefore, clustering-based systems require careful joint calibration building process. Second, systems jointly optimized minimize diarization errors; clustering particular unsupervised process. Finally, clustering accommodate overlapping speech naturally, even though recent work proposed ways handle regions simultaneously active speakers clustering . End-to-end neural diarization self-attention one approaches aim model joint speech activity multiple speakers. It integrates voice activity overlap detection speaker tracking end-to-end fashion. Moreover, directly minimizes diarization errors demonstrated excellent diarization accuracy two-speaker telephone conversations. However, EEND originally formulated limited fixed number speakers output dimension neural network needs prespecified. Several methods proposed recently overcome limitations EEND. One approach uses speaker-wise chain rule decode speaker-specific speech activity iteratively conditioned previously estimated speech activities . Another approach proposes encoder/decoder-based attractor calculation . The embeddings multiple speakers accumulated time course audio input, disentangled one-by-one, speaker identity assignment speech frame. However, state-of-the-art EEND methods work offline manner, means complete recording must available diarization output generated. This makes application impractical settings potentially long multi-speaker recordings need processed incrementally . In study, propose novel method perform EEND blockwise online fashion speaker identities tracked low latency soon new audio arrives, without much degradation accuracy compared offline system. We utilize incremental Transformer encoder, attend left contexts ignore right contexts, thus enabling blockwise online processing. Furthermore, incremental Transformer encoder uses block-level recurrence hidden states carry information block block, reducing computation time attending previous blocks. To knowledge, first method uses incremental Transformer encoder block-level recurrence enable online speaker diarization. In work, presented novel approach retrieval relevant original premises query claims. Our new approach applied flexibly previous methods since require mappings premises claims database. Thus, also applied inductive setting, new premises used without need first associate relevant claims manually. At time, achieves better results approaches make use information."," We present a novel online end-to-end neural diarization system, BW-EDA-EEND, that processes data incrementally for a variable number of speakers. The system is based on the Encoder-Decoder-Attractor  architecture of Horiguchi et al., but utilizes the incremental Transformer encoder, attending only to its left contexts and using block-level recurrence in the hidden states to carry information from block to block, making the algorithm complexity linear in time. We propose two variants: For unlimited-latency BW-EDA-EEND, which processes inputs in linear time, we show only moderate degradation for up to two speakers using a context size of 10 seconds compared to offline EDA-EEND. With more than two speakers, the accuracy gap between online and offline grows, but the algorithm still outperforms a baseline offline clustering diarization system for one to four speakers with unlimited context size, and shows comparable accuracy with context size of 10 seconds. For limited-latency BW-EDA-EEND, which produces diarization outputs block-by-block as audio arrives, we show accuracy comparable to the offline clustering-based system."

Book genre classification based on its cover would be utterly beneficial to many modern retrieval systems, considering that the complete digitization of books is an extremely expensive task. At the same time, it is also an extremely challenging task due to the following reasons: First, there exists a wide variety of book genres, many of which are not concretely defined. Second, book covers, as graphic designs, vary in many different ways such as colors, styles, textual information, etc, even for books of the same genre. Third, book cover designs may vary due to many external factors such as country, culture, target reader populations, etc. With the growing competitiveness in the book industry, the book cover designers and typographers push the cover designs to its limit in the hope of attracting sales. The cover-based book classification systems become a particularly exciting research topic in recent years. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal deep learning framework to solve this problem. The contribution of this paper is four-fold. First, our method adds an extra modality by extracting texts automatically from the book covers. Second, image-based and text-based, state-of-the-art models are evaluated thoroughly for the task of book cover classification. Third, we develop an efficient  and salable multi-modal framework based on the images and texts shown on the covers only.  Fourth, a thorough analysis of the experimental results is given and future works to improve the performance is suggested. The results show that the multi-modal framework significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art image-based models. However, more efforts and resources are needed for this classification task in order to reach a satisfactory level."

"Deep neural networks powerful widely applied natural language processing. However, recent studies demonstrate models vulnerable adversarial examples, malicious inputs intentionally crafted fool models. % The introduction adversarial example ushered new era understand improve neural network-based models. % Adversarial attacks defenses attacks drawn significant attention recent years . Although generating adversarial examples texts proven challenging task images due discrete nature, number methods proposed generate adversarial text examples reveal vulnerability deep neural networks natural language processing tasks including reading comprehension , text classification , machine translation , dialogue systems , dependency parsing . These methods attack text examples replacing, scrambling, erasing characters words language units. To settle susceptible attack direction, require large number queries target model predictions given inputs. Thus adversarial examples typically generated specific model. This motivates main questions aim answer paper: Are universal adversarial examples fool almost every neural network-based model? And universal attack rules constructing universal adversarial examples? %are universal adversarial examples transfer neural network-based models? It well known adversarial examples exhibit black-box transferability, meaning adversarial examples generated one model fool another model . Transfer attackers launch white-box attacks local models find candidate adversarial examples may transfer target model. % In white-box setting, adversary access model's architecture, parameters input feature representations black-box one. % However, adversarial examples typically overfitted particular architecture feature representation source model, resulting sub-optimal black-box transfer attacks target models. However, factors affect transferability adversarial examples still unclear, especially NLP models. In study, quantitatively investigate adversarial transferability impacted several critical factors, including network architecture, input form, word embedding type, model capacity. Based understanding transferability among various neural models, study whether possible craft universal, model-agnostic text adversarial examples almost existing models. Universal adversarial examples least two advantages. First, adversaries need white-box access target models. They launch attacks models trained similar data, transfer across models . Second, universal adversarial examples useful analysis tool because, unlike typical attacks, model-agnostic. Thus, highlight general input-output patterns learned model.

In many cases, malicious inputs intentionally crafted for one model can fool another model in the black-box attack setting. However, there is a lack of systematic studies on the transferability of adversarial examples and how to generate universal adversarial examples.  In this paper, we systematically study the transferability of adversarial attacks for text classification models.  In particular, we conduct extensive experiments to investigate how various factors, such as network architecture, input format, word embedding, and model capacity, affect the transferability of adversarial attacks.  Based on these studies, we then propose universal black-box attack algorithms that can induce adversarial examples to attack almost all existing models. These universal adversarial examples reflect the defects of the learning process and the bias in the training dataset.  Finally, we generalize these adversarial examples into universal word replacement rules that can be used for model diagnostics.     \if0 It has been known that adversarial examples exhibit black box transfer, i.e. malicious inputs intentionally crafted for one model can also cause another model to make mistakes. However, which factors affect the most and how they impact the transferability of adversarial examples are still unclear, especially for NLP models.  Through extensive experiments, we systematically investigate how adversarial transferability is impacted with a few critical, model-specific factors, including the network architecture, input form, pre-trained word embedding, and model capacity. Based on the understanding of the adversarial transferability among neural models, we propose a population-based algorithm to find an optimal ensemble with minimum number of models, which can be used to generate adversarial examples that strongly transfer across other neural models.  We also generalize the adversarial examples generated by the ensemble method into universal word replacement rules that can induce adversaries on any text input to fool almost all the existing models with a much higher success rate. Those rules also help us to identify dataset biases and diagnose heuristics improperly learned by the models. \fi"
"Recent works shown NN models trained solely maximize prediction performance often vulnerable adversarial attacks . Even though several works proposed defend NN models attacks, focus NLP domain . Since many recent NLP models shown vulnerable adversarial attacks--e.g., fake news detection dialog system , investigation robust defense methods textual NN models become necessary. To defend adversarial texts, one use either adversarial detection model enhancement . Adversarial texts often generated replacing inserting critical words characters sentence, usually exhibiting grammatical errors. Hence, many detection methods focused recognizing correcting misspellings texts--e.g., ScRNN DISP . While misspelling-based methods model-independent require neither re-training modifying models, work well character-based attacks. In contrast, model enhancement approaches perform well character word-based attacks. %Such generalization variety attacks critical since one might know type adversarial techniques employed adversaries. Particularly, model enhancement methods enrich NN models training adversarial data augmented via known attack strategies adversarial training , external information knowledge graphs . Nevertheless, augmentations usually induce overhead costs training. Therefore, search defense algorithms directly enhance models' structures achieving higher extendability without acquiring additional data. %While developing solutions challenging still exploration . Fortunately, recent literature computer vision shows ensemble NNs achieve high adversarial robustness . In theory, directly extending single NN model ensemble multiple diverse sub-models, challenge adversaries attack one set different models . This makes attacks significantly difficult. However, applying idea computer vision NLP domain faces one main challenge. Current ensemble methods require simultaneous training several NN sub-models . This introduces impractical computational overhead training inference, especially one wants maximize prediction accuracy utilizing complex state-of-the-art sub-models BERT ROBERTA , 100M parameters. Furthermore, applying current ensemble defensive approaches directly enhance model's architecture large-scale NN model would usually require re-training everything scratch, may practical many settings. % Second, current ensemble approaches aim promote diversity sub-models either feature-level class-level . % Second, current ensemble approaches promote diversity sub-models maximizing differences among either prediction output vectors gradient vectors w.r.t input image . However, NLP tasks, classification particularly, much less labels computer vision, results much smaller degree-of-freedom directly regularizing differences prediciton probability vectors. % On hand, forcing sub-models focus different tokens input text directly regularizing gradient vectors straightforward text discrete nature. This easily resolved regularizing gradients w.r.t continuous word-embedding vectors sentence instead. However, since every sub-model contributes equally input, many overlaps among key features, i.e., words phrases, sub-models input text short. To address challenges, borrowing ideas Software Engineering, first introducing notion {\bf Neural Patching} improve adversarial robustness NN models ``patching"" parts models . Next, develop novel neural patching algorithm, {\mymethod}, patches last layer already deployed textual NN model diverse architectures transforms ensemble multi-experts enhanced adversarial robustness. By patching last layer model, {\mymethod} introduces lightweight computational overhead requires additional training data. %requires low construction overheads without compromising much computational complexity additional training data. Distinguished current ensemble methods, sub-model trained {\mymethod} specialized specific subset features input, i.e., expert feature-level , sub-set labels, i.e., expert class-level , also texts distinguished topic, i.e., expert instance-level, prediction. Such diversity feature-, class-, instance-level expertise makes challenging adversaries exploit multiple sub-models time. In summary, contributions paper follows: %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% In study, investigated four critical factors NLP neural models, including network architectures, input forms, embedding types, model capacities impact transferability text adversarial examples different models. Based understanding transferability among models, proposed genetic algorithm find optimal ensemble models used generate adversarial examples transfer well models. We also described algorithm discover universal adversarial word replacement rules applied craft adversarial examples strong transferability across various neural models without access them. Finally, since adversarial examples model-agnostic, provide analysis global model behavior help identify dataset biases. {\small }"," Neural network  models that are solely trained to maximize the likelihood of an observed dataset are often vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Even though several methods have been proposed to enhance NN models' adversarial robustness, they often require re-training from scratch. This leads to redundant computation, especially in the NLP domain where current state-of-the-art models, such as BERT and ROBERTA, require great time and space resources. By borrowing ideas from Software Engineering, we, therefore, first introduce the Neural Patching mechanism to improve adversarial robustness by ``patching"" only parts of a NN model. Then, we propose a novel neural patching algorithm, {\mymethod}, that transforms a textual NN model into a stochastic ensemble of multi-expert predictors by upgrading and re-training its last layer only. {\mymethod} forces adversaries to attack not only one but multiple models that are specialized in diverse sub-sets of features, labels, and instances so that the ensemble model becomes more robust to adversarial attacks. By conducting comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that all of CNN, RNN, BERT, and ROBERTA-based textual models, once patched by {\mymethod}, witness an absolute increase of as much as 20\% in accuracy on average under 5 different white and black-box attacks, outperforming 6 defensive baselines across 4 public NLP datasets.

One challenges text emotion recognition ambiguous words, resulting omitted words . On hand, one challenges speech emotion recognition creating efficient model. However, paper focuses recognition speech emotions. In area, two types information, linguistic paralinguistic, mainly considered speech emotion recognition. The linguistic information refers meaning context speech. The paralinguistic information implies implicit message meaning, like emotion speech . Speech characteristics interpret meaning speech; therefore, behavioral expression investigated speech emotion recognition works . In recent works, local feature learning block , one efficient methods, used integrating local global speech emotion features, provide better results recognition. Inside LFLB, convolution neural network used extracting local features, long short-term memory applied extracting contextual dependencies local features learn time-related relationship.

Recent SERs were based on a deep learning approach. However, the efficiency of deep learning depends on the number of layers, i.e., the deeper layers, the higher efficiency. On the other hand, the deeper layers are causes of a vanishing gradient problem, a low learning rate, and high time-consuming. Therefore, this paper proposed a redesign of existing local feature learning block . The new design is called a deep residual local feature learning block . DeepResLFLB consists of three cascade blocks: LFLB, residual local feature learning block , and multilayer perceptron . LFLB is built for learning local correlations along with extracting hierarchical correlations; DeepResLFLB can take advantage of repeatedly learning to explain more detail in deeper layers using residual learning for solving vanishing gradient and reducing overfitting; and MLP is adopted to find the relationship of learning and discover probability for predicted speech emotions and gender types. Based on two available published datasets: EMODB鐠虹棏nd RAVDESS, the proposed DeepResLFLB can significantly improve performance when evaluated by standard metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  \keywords{Speech Emotion Recognition \and Residual Feature Learning \and CNN Network \and Log-Mel Spectrogram \and Chromagram}"
"As growth robots interacting humans, different levels environment understanding required robot. A robot acting environment deal many open questions, thus needs different levels reasoning task. Usually, robots rely initial knowledge, perception cognitive abilities able understand reasoning situated environment. A recently hooked topic better Knowledge-Based cognition dialogic interaction human robot, robot captures fresh information environment user Natural Language. Information comes Natural Language together visually perceived information, Knowledge Base lets cognitive agent reach different levels understanding environment. The first level understanding seen classification detection sensory inputs, e.g. detection objects visual perception, role tagging lexical sentence. The second level understanding concerns finding relations different sensory inputs, e.g. finding common attributes language vision. Some famous problems symbol grounding anchoring concern finding correspondences different sensory input modalities. A higher abstract level understanding thought find relations entities environment. e.g. scene desk book top, relationships relative physical position semantics shows entities similar. Understanding relationships physical entities also extended attributes entities. Indeed definition relationship entities found attributes. For example, user declares freshness attribute 'apple-1' 'spoiled', well 'apple-2' 'apple-3', 'orange-1' 'banana-1' 'fresh', relation values freshness attribute exists connects semantic entities; In example, apples 'spoiled', rest fruits 'fresh', closed world assumption. Relation rules attributes entities help robot interacting human many applications. For example user utters ""bring fruit"", using rules obtained freshness attribute, robot notices fruits spoiled fresh eat. Such logical rules attributes let robot realize apples spoiled, apples thrown out, added shopping list. Moreover, obtained rule attributes used robot's low-level sensory input processing. Consider utterance user example declaring physical entity spoiled, robot's visual perception doubt whether perceived object apple pear. As robot already found apples spoiled fruits fresh, perceptual detection refines recognized object apple. %Different attributes represent characteristics entity, computed visual perception Natural Language interaction user. In work, deal nine different attributes, category, color, label, functionality, owner, size, weight, restriction, location entities scene; first two computed visual perception rest obtained Natural Language. %%It worth emphasis importance attributes come Natural Language. Such information almost impossible obtain visual perception, e.g. information user give owner entity, cannot obtained camera. Also, initial knowledge base gives information category entity, particular entity , assignments might temporary. On hand, information size, weight, location, may used refinement knowledge base camera, shortcut obtaining information user.

Handling data skewness crucial problem learning imbalanced data inevitably brings bias toward frequently observed classes. Data-level manipulation tries under-sample majority classes over-sample minority classes. But methods tend discard valuable information observations majority classes overfit sparse representation minority classes, especially imbalance level gets higher.

Entities are described by their attributes, and entities that share attributes are often semantically related.  For example, if two books have ``Natural Language Processing'' as value of their `title' attribute, we can expect that their `topic' attribute will also be equal, namely, ``NLP''.  Humans tend to generalize such observations, and infer sufficient conditions under which the `topic' attribute of any entity is ``NLP''.  If robots need to interact successfully with humans, they need to represent entities, attributes, and generalizations in a similar way. This ends in a contextualized cognitive agent that can adapt its understanding, where context provides sufficient conditions for a correct understanding. In this work, we address the problem of how to obtain these representations through human-robot interaction.  We integrate visual perception and natural language input to incrementally build a semantic model of the world, and then use inductive reasoning to infer logical rules that capture generic semantic relations, true in this model.  These relations can be used to enrich the human-robot interaction, to populate a knowledge base with inferred facts, or to remove uncertainty in the robot's sensory inputs."

The ability leverage context understand emotions communicated verbally non-verbally trivial humans remains difficult machines . Emotional responses depend psyche physiology governed perception situations, people objects. They also depend mental state . The way exhibit perceive emotion may also differ based age, gender, race, culture accent .

We also interested exploring effectiveness transferring auxiliary tasks like automated speech recognition."," We propose Universal MelGAN, a vocoder that synthesizes high-fidelity speech in multiple domains. To preserve sound quality when the MelGAN-based structure is trained with a dataset of hundreds of speakers, we added multi-resolution spectrogram discriminators to sharpen the spectral resolution of the generated waveforms. This enables the model to generate realistic waveforms of multi-speakers, by alleviating the over-smoothing problem in the high frequency band of the large footprint model. Our structure generates signals close to ground-truth data without reducing the inference speed, by discriminating the waveform and spectrogram during training. The model achieved the best mean opinion score  in most scenarios using ground-truth mel-spectrogram as an input. Especially, it showed superior performance in unseen domains with regard of speaker, emotion, and language. Moreover, in a multi-speaker text-to-speech scenario using mel-spectrogram generated by a transformer model, it synthesized high-fidelity speech of 4.22 MOS. These results, achieved without external domain information, highlight the potential of the proposed model as a universal vocoder."
"%What spoken term detection Unsupervised speech modeling task discovering modeling speech units various levels audio recording without using prior linguistic information.

The result demonstrates universality proposed model. For general use model, study lightweight model future apply multi-band strategy reduce complexity preserving sound quality."," Spoken term discovery from untranscribed speech audio could be achieved via a two-stage process. In the first stage, the unlabelled speech is decoded into a sequence of subword units that are learned and modelled in an unsupervised manner. In the second stage, partial sequence matching and clustering are performed on the decoded subword sequences, resulting in a set of discovered words or phrases. A limitation of this approach is that the results of subword decoding could be erroneous, and the errors would impact the subsequent steps. While Siamese/Triplet network is one approach to learn segment representations that can improve the discovery process, the challenge in spoken term discovery under a complete unsupervised scenario is that training examples are unavailable. In this paper, we propose to generate training examples from initial hypothesized sequence clusters. The Siamese/Triplet network is trained on the hypothesized examples to measure the similarity between two speech segments and hereby perform re-clustering of all hypothesized subword sequences to achieve spoken term discovery.  Experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective in obtaining training examples for Siamese and Triplet networks, improving the efficacy of spoken term discovery as compared with the original two-stage method."

To perform topic discovery, existing neural models use document bag-of-words  representation as input followed by variational inference and learn topic-word distribution through reconstructing BoW. Such methods have mainly focused on analysing the effect of enforcing suitable priors on document distribution. However, little importance has been given to encoding improved document features for capturing document semantics better. In this work, we propose a novel framework: TAN-NTM which models document as a sequence of tokens instead of BoW at the input layer and processes it through an LSTM whose output is used to perform variational inference followed by BoW decoding. We apply attention on LSTM outputs to empower the model to attend on relevant words which convey topic related cues. We hypothesise that attention can be performed effectively if done in a topic guided manner and establish this empirically through ablations. We factor in topic-word distribution to perform topic aware attention achieving state-of-the-art results with $\sim$ $9$ - $15$ percentage improvement over score of existing SOTA topic models in NPMI coherence metric on four benchmark datasets - 20NewsGroup, Yelp, AGNews, DBpedia. TAN-NTM also obtains better document classification accuracy owing to learning improved document-topic features. We qualitatively discuss that attention mechanism enables unsupervised discovery of keywords. Motivated by this, we further show that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on topic aware supervised generation of keyphrases on StackExchange and Weibo datasets."

"In recent years, smart devices built-in personal assistants like Google Assistant Siri becoming omnipresent. Behind intelligent systems, key question identify underlying intent user utterance, triggered large amount work intent detection . Most existing intent detection systems built deep learning models trained large-scale annotated data. However, user demands functions smart devices continue grow, collecting supervised data every new intent becomes time-consuming labor-intensive. To address issue, studies tackle intent detection zero-shot learning manner, attempting utilize learned knowledge seen classes help detect unseen classes. The recent methods zero-shot intent detection roughly divided two categories: The first category , referred transformation-based methods, utilizes word embeddings label names establish similarity matrix, used transfer prediction space seen intents unseen intents. Another line work based compatibility-based methods , aims encode label names utterances representations semantic space calculate similarity. In kinds methods, critical problem learning intent representations. However, existing ZSID methods class-inductive, relies entirely labeled data seen intents training stage. Consequently, representations unseen intents cannot learned, resulting two limitations. First, ZSID methods good modeling relationship seen unseen intents. For transformation-based methods, label names given form raw phrases sentences, word embeddings label names inadequate associate connections seen unseen intents. For example, 閳ユ窂ookRestaurant閳 similar 閳ユ珐ateBook閳 measured word embeddings, share word 閳ユ窂ook閳 . However, meaning two intents relevant. % As result, computed similarity matrix inadequate associating connections seen unseen intents . For compatibility-based methods, minimize similarity seen intent samples seen label names shared semantic space, directly transfer detect unseen intents. Since unseen intent representations learned, might entangled representations seen intents. This severely hurt accuracy predicted label-utterance similarity, especially expressions utterances diverse. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% % %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Second, vanilla ZSL methods applicable generalized intent detection . Compared ZSL setting , assumes models presented utterances unseen classes test time, GZSID requires model detect seen unseen intents. In GZSID, existing ZSL models usually suffer dubbed domain shift problem, utterances unseen intents almost always mistakenly classified seen intents. Unlike class-inductive methods, class-transductive ZSL uses semantic information unseen classes model training . In context intent detection, label name provides proper sketch intent meaning. Motivated this, propose utilize label names unseen intents learn disentangled intent representations . Specifically, include unseen intents prediction space training, label names serving pseudo utterances. This allows model learn boundary seen unseen class semantic space. Under framework, introduce assistant task forces model find distinction seen unseen intents, thereby alleviating domain-shift problem. On basis, refine word embedding based similarity matrix averaging representations corresponding utterances label names. As result, better capture intent meanings similarity matrix reflects accurate intent connections. In summary, contribution three-fold: We believe potential class-transductive ZSL intent detection still fully exploited, encourage related studies future, release codes data. In paper, investigated two approaches cross-lingual neural discourse parsing. Experimental results show utilizing cross-lingual representation adopting segment-level translation contribute obtaining state-of-the-art performance various treebanks. Moreover, monolingual models also benefit cross-lingual training introducing data domains. For future work, consider conducting domain adaption via few-shot learning make approach generalizable."," Zero-shot intent detection  aims to deal with the continuously emerging intents without annotated training data. However, existing ZSID systems suffer from two limitations: 1) They are not good at modeling the relationship between seen and unseen intents, when the label names are given in the form of raw phrases or sentences. 2) They cannot effectively recognize unseen intents under the generalized intent detection  setting. A critical factor behind these limitations is the representations of unseen intents, which cannot be learned in the training stage. To address this problem, we propose a class-transductive framework that utilizes unseen class labels to learn Disentangled Intent Representations . Specifically, we allow the model to predict unseen intents in the training stage, with the corresponding label names serving as input utterances. Under this framework, we introduce a multi-task learning objective, which encourages the model to learn the distinctions among intents, and a similarity scorer, which estimates the connections among intents more accurately based on the learned intent representations. % Moreover, we present a novel approach to calculate the inter-intent similarities, on the basis of the learned intent representations, which estimates the connections among intents more accurately.  Since the purpose of DIR is to provide better intent representations, it can be easily integrated with existing ZSID and GZSID methods. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that the proposed framework brings consistent improvement to the baseline systems, regardless of the model architectures or zero-shot learning strategies."

As the size of attention-based models has been scaling with the available computational resources, a number of pruning techniques have been developed to detect and to exploit sparseness in such models in order to make them more efficient. The majority of such efforts have focused on looking for attention patterns and then hard-coding them to achieve sparseness, or pruning the weights of the attention mechanisms based on statistical information from the training data. In this paper, we marry these two lines of research by proposing Attention Pruning : a novel pruning framework that collects observations about the attention patterns in a fixed dataset and then induces a global sparseness mask for the model. Through attention pruning, we find that about 90\% of the attention computation can be reduced for language modelling and about 50\% for machine translation and %natural language inference \rev{prediction with BERT on GLUE tasks}, while maintaining the quality of  the results. Additionally, using our method, we discovered important distinctions between self- and cross-attention patterns, which could guide future NLP research in attention-based modelling. Our approach could help develop better models for existing or for new NLP applications, and generally for any model that relies on attention mechanisms. Our implementation and instructions to reproduce the experiments are available at \url{https://github.com/irugina/AP}."

This property simplifies its implementation but reduces its classification accuracy. Increasing the depth of char-CNN architectures does not result in breakthrough accuracy improvements. Research has not established which char-CNN architectures are optimal for text classification tasks. Manually designing and training char-CNNs is an iterative and time-consuming process that requires expert domain knowledge. Evolutionary deep learning  techniques, including surrogate-based versions, have demonstrated success in automatically searching for performant CNN architectures for image analysis tasks. Researchers have not applied EDL techniques to search the architecture space of char-CNNs for text classification tasks. This article demonstrates the first work in evolving char-CNN architectures using a novel EDL algorithm based on genetic programming, an indirect encoding and surrogate models, to search for performant char-CNN architectures automatically. The algorithm is evaluated on eight text classification datasets and benchmarked against five manually designed CNN architectures and one long short-term memory  architecture. Experiment results indicate that the algorithm can evolve architectures that outperform the LSTM in terms of classification accuracy and five of the manually designed CNN architectures in terms of classification accuracy and parameter count."

"%Recently, Neural machine translation~ achieved great success reached satisfactory translation performances several language pairs~. %These NMT models sequence-to-sequence models trained large parallel data. % Ensemble learning, aggregates multiple diverse models inference, attracted huge interest academia industry communities thanks effectiveness variety computational intelligence problems classification, prediction function approximation.

Previous studies show performance ensemble method heavily depends accuracy diversity base models, typically obtained independent training different sets attributes. % % Ensemble learning, aggregates multiple models inference, % Despite success various tasks applications, practice common challenges ensemble methods, prevent wide usage: 1) High computational cost. For ensemble learning, individual models conduct encoding decoding, prohibitively time memory consuming. It gets even worse context NMT due large size state-of-the-art networks like transformer. 2) Absence monolingual data. Ensemble exploit independence cannot make full use large scale monolingual data source side. Recently, self-training method shown remarkable success image recognition. % Taking advantage unlabeled data, Trained noisy augmented data, EfficientNet model finetuned self-training achieve 87.4\% top-1 accuracy ImageNet, 1.0\% better state-of-the-art model requires 3.5B weakly labeled images. Typically, self-training first train base model labeled data, utilize learned model label unannotated data. Finally, labeled pseudo data combined training set yield next level model. In context natural language processing, many works successfully applied self-training technique including word sense disambiguation parsing. % Nevertheless, performance gains achieved self-training still limited structured prediction tasks Neural Machine Translation~ target space vast. Originally designed classification problems, previous work suggests self-training effective predictions unlabeled samples good enough, otherwise suffer notorious reinforced mistakes. However, problem common NMT scenario, hypotheses generated single model often far away ground-truth target due compositionality target space. \citet{zhang2016exploiting} found training biased pseudo data may accumulate mistakes time step enlarge error, thus propose freeze decoder parameters training pseudo parallel data may negatively impact decoder model NMT. % We argue performance drop self-training NMT mainly comes reinforced mistakes. To overcome issue, paper borrow reciprocal teaching concept educational field revisit core idea classic ensemble approaches. Ensemble built upon assumption different models different inductive biases better predictions made majority voting. We propose replace self-supervision Reciprocal-Supervision NMT, leading novel co-EM scheme named \method.

More specifically, first learn multiple different models parallel data. Then E-step individual models used translate monolingual data. And M-step generated pseudo data produced different models combined tune student models. %To combine advantages diversities, intuitive method ensemble, several models trained every model used inference, output models combined better prediction. \method inspired success ensemble method.

Despite the recent success on image classification, self-training has only achieved limited gains on structured prediction tasks such as neural machine translation . This is mainly due to the compositionality of the target space, where the far-away prediction hypotheses lead to the notorious reinforced mistake problem. In this paper, we revisit the utilization of multiple diverse models and present a simple yet effective approach named Reciprocal-Supervised Learning . \method first exploits individual models to generate pseudo parallel data, and then cooperatively trains each model on the combined synthetic corpus. \method leverages the fact that different parameterized models have different inductive biases, and better predictions can be made by jointly exploiting the agreement among each other. Unlike the previous knowledge distillation methods built upon a much stronger teacher, \method is capable of boosting the accuracy of one model by introducing other comparable or even weaker models. \method can also be viewed as a more efficient alternative to ensemble. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of \method on several benchmarks with significant margins.\footnote{Code is available at \url{https://github.com/MinkaiXu/RSL-NMT}.} % \method takes advantage of different parameterized networks to generate diverse proper pseudo parallel data, and then dramatically reduce the bias through strategic combination of the pseudo data. %More specifically, we first train several NMT teachers with heterogeneous networks, then use the heterogeneous teacher models to label unlabeled data respectively and finally use the labeled data and unlabeled data to jointly train a student NMT model. % \method is very simple but much effective. % Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of \method on several benchmarks, where we even outperforms a strong BERT-enhanced baseline.   % Ensemble learning, which strategically aggregates multiple models for inference, has been shown effective to improve the accuracy of Neural Machine Translation . However, in practice it cannot be widely adopted due to the high computation and memory cost for involving all individual models.  % % Recently, transductive method has been proposed to overcome this obstacle, which, however, suffers the premise that the test data has to be available in advance.  % In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach named Cooperative Training NMT , where we firstly use individual models to translate the source corpus into pseudo parallel data, and then cooperatively train all models on the translated synthetic corpus. \method leverages the fact that different parameterized models have different inductive biases, and better predictions can be made by jointly exploiting the independence between each other. Furthermore, given source monolingual data, \method enables us to avoid the reinforced mistakes problem of self-training and make the most of the monolingual set. Extensive experiments demonstrate our proposed approach can always achieve superior or comparable performance on several benchmarks with less computational cost."

"Hypernym, sometimes also known hyperonym, term linguistics referring word phrase whose semantic field covers hyponym. The common relationship hypernym hyponym ``is-a'' relationship. For example, ``red color'' provides relationship ``red'' ``color'', ``color'' hypernym ``red''. The hypernym-hyponym relation essential element semantic network corresponding tasks related semantic network analysis . The hypernym graph built collection hyponym-hypernym relations enhance accuracy taxonomy induction . The linkage hyponym hypernym used improve performance link prediction network completion knowledge graph semantic network . In natural language processing , hyponym-hypernym relation help named entity recognition , question-answering tasks ``what is'' ``is a'' . The data mining, information search retrieval also benefit hyponym-hypernym relation . Given role application hypernym-hyponym relation, essential explore automatic method extract relation two entities, presents important task knowledge-driven NLP . Following landmark work focusing lexico-syntactic patterns , several pattern-based methods developed hypernym extraction . Then feature-based classification methods introduced , applies machine learning tools enhance recall rate. Recently, distributional methods hybrid distributional models successfully applied learn embedding words, based hypernym-hyponym relation inferred . The deep learning approach also effective many sequence labeling tasks including hypernym extraction . While extraction hyponym-hypernym relation done many different environments, work focus hypernym extraction definitions. More specifically, definition refers short statement description word. Take word ``red'' example, whose definition Wikipedia ``Red color end visible spectrum light, next orange opposite violet.'' The aim identify word ``color'' hypernym ``red'' nouns definition. Intuitively, task solved general resources WordNet dictionary Wikipedia. But given word's different meanings different contexts, resources sufficiently complete task. As example, term ``LDA'' Wikipedia denotes ``Linear Discriminant Analysis'' machine learning, ``Low dose allergens'' medicine, ``Landing distance available'' aviation. The combination general resources context identification would also fail domain-specific applications general resources cover special technical terms area. Moreover, existing technical approaches also demonstrate certain limitations task hypernym extraction definitions, summarize follows: To briefly illustrate difficulty, let us consider definition Stack-Overflow irregular format: ``fetch-api: fetch API improved replacement XHR''. The term ``fetch-api'' included common dictionary. While definition ``is an'' pattern, connect hypernym. The definition short every distinct word definition appears once, makes difficult accurately learn word representation. Overall, challenging find method would accurately identify ``API'' correct hypernym. The definition word represents certain type knowledge extracted collected disordered data. Indeed, tools capable extracting definitions corpora good accuracy . Nevertheless, tools extract hypernym definitions remain limited. % To cope issue, propose recurrent network method using syntactic features. Because definition directly points noun, hyponym already given. Therefore, hypernym extraction identify correct hypernym words definition sentence. This task considered binary classification, classifier judges candidate noun hypernym not. In order better learn syntactic feature, transfer definition sentence part speech sequence labeling PoS word standard tool . The syntactic structure surrounding candidate learned bidirectional gated recurrent units based model. To fine tune results, use set features including centrality word hypernym co-occurrence network. We use two corpora evaluate method. One Wikipedia, featuring definitions canonical syntax structure intensively used previous studies. The Stack-Overflow, whose definition domain-specific usually irregular format. Our method compared several existing ones. Overall, outperforms others corpora, demonstrates advantage combing tool RNN PoS information task hypernym extraction. This paper organized follows. We review related works Section introduce details method Section . Experiments evaluations proposed model presented Section . After that, draw conclusion research Section . The computational level analysis allows us contemplate problem cognitive phenomenon solves. For example, learning word meanings via cross-situational statistics formulated finding mappings words referents consistent observations. On hand, modeling cognition algorithmic level plays important role providing insight cognitive mechanisms; requires specifying details algorithms representations turn enables us study role interaction different stages learning. Previous research studied word learning algorithmic computational levels \citep[\eg,][]{siskind.1996,yu.ballard.2007,frank.etal.2007,fazly.etal.2010.csj}. We proposed framework modeling cross-situational word learning computational level unifies previous work domain -- approaches formulate word learning translation problem. We also show instantiating framework results different word learning models algorithmic level: model specific inductive biases define words referents compete association strength given word/referent. More specifically, examine competition among words referents plays role in: learning given observation in-the-moment learning, overall learning word meanings, comprehension given word. Moreover, investigate assumptions change performance model face uncertainty. Our results show models implement two complementary types referent word competition perform best. Each competition type addresses specific type uncertainty -- word referent competitions address linguistic referential certainty, respectively; word learning input uncertainties, important model implement two competitions. These models robust learn successfully examples. Moreover, find best model implements competition in-the-moment learning comprehension, global competition word meaning representations. By avoiding overall word meaning competition, model able successfully learn multiple meanings ambiguous words, given sufficient evidence. \section{The Derivation FAS model} The FAS model assumes referents generated independently given utterance ; instead calculating \Equation{eq:cll}, likelihood defined conditional probability referents given utterance: Here, alignment variable defines mappings words given referent.

The FAS model assumes conditional probability, . This means additional dependence assumption learned representations: word distribution features, thus given word, features compete associated word. To impose new assumption representation, constraint added expectation defined \Equation{eq:mstepfas}: Note Lagrange multipliers ensures new constraint -- distribution referents word -- satisfied. To find maximizes expectation \Equation{eq:mstepfas}, derivative objective function calculated equated zero: Given , calculate : Using \Equation{eq:emfasalign} calculate alignment probabilities, have: We approximate adding current alignment probability, , sum previously calculated ones .

The hyponym-hypernym relation is an essential element in the semantic network. Identifying the hypernym from a definition is an important task in natural language processing and semantic analysis. While a public dictionary such as WordNet works for common words, its application in domain-specific scenarios is limited. Existing tools for hypernym extraction either rely on specific semantic patterns or focus on the word representation, which all demonstrate certain limitations. Here we propose a method by combining both the syntactic structure in definitions given by the word闁炽儲鐛 part of speech, and the bidirectional gated recurrent unit network as the learning kernel. The output can be further tuned by including other features such as a word闁炽儲鐛 centrality in the hypernym co-occurrence network. The method is tested in the corpus from Wikipedia featuring definition with high regularity, and the corpus from Stack-Overflow whose definition is usually irregular. It shows enhanced performance compared with other tools in both corpora. Taken together, our work not only provides a useful tool for hypernym extraction but also gives an example of utilizing syntactic structures to learn semantic relationships \footnote{Source code and data available at \url{https://github.com/Res-Tan/Hypernym-Extraction}}.  \keywords{Hypernym Extraction \and Syntactic Structure \and Word Representation \and Part of Speech \and Gated Recurrent Units.}"
"Although neural machine translation achieved great success sentence-level translation tasks, many studies pointed translation mistakes become noticeable document-level. They proved mistakes alleviated feeding inter-sentential contexts context-agnostic NMT models. Previous works explored various methods integrate context information NMT models. They usually take limited number previous sentences contexts learn context-aware representations using hierarchical networks extra context encoders . Different representation-based approaches, ~\citeauthor{tu2018learning}~\shortcite{tu2018learning} ~\citeauthor{kuang-etal-2018-modeling}~\shortcite{kuang-etal-2018-modeling} propose using cache memorize context information, either history hidden states lexicons. To keep tracking recent contexts, cache usually updated new translations generated. Therefore, long-distance contexts would likely erased. How use long-distance contexts drawing attention recent years. Approaches, like treating whole document long sentence using memory hierarchical structures , proposed take global contexts consideration. However, \citeauthor{kim2019and}~\shortcite{kim2019and} point words document beneficial context integration, suggesting essential word focus relevant context. \footnotetext{Dependency coreference relations Stanford CoreNLP .} To address problem, suppose build document graph document, word connected words direct influence translation. Figure shows example document graph. Explicitly, document graph %for document defined directed graph where: node represents word document; edge represents one following relations words: adjacency; syntactic dependency; lexical consistency; coreference.

Hence, useful develop capable tool task. Here construct bidirectional GRU model patterns learning. We use PoS tags words surrounding hypernym feature. Our model outperforms existing methods general corpus domain-specific corpus . It also demonstrates good balance performance complexity, compared kernels Transformer Bert. More importantly, feature kernel ablation, show PoS feature indeed key element guarantees final performance. The application tool proposed Stack-Overflow would help us understand evolution technology, group users social network study, build semantic network domain computer science. The performance tool limited accuracy PoS tagging. Hence, would useful try develop methods Stanford-NLP tool. The use PoS feature may also potential text sequence labeling tasks, may advantages word embedding. All problems addressed future studies.","     Previous works have shown that contextual information can improve the performance of neural machine translation . However, most existing document-level NMT methods failed to leverage contexts beyond a few set of previous sentences. How to make use of the whole document as global contexts is still a challenge. To address this issue, we hypothesize that a document can be represented as a graph     that connects relevant contexts regardless of their distances. We employ several types of relations, including adjacency, syntactic dependency, lexical consistency, and coreference, to construct the document graph. Then, we incorporate both source and target graphs into the conventional Transformer architecture with graph convolutional networks. Experiments on various NMT benchmarks, including IWSLT English--French, Chinese-English, WMT English--German and Opensubtitle English--Russian, demonstrate that using document graphs can significantly improve the translation quality."

We first transform the entire meeting text with dialogue discourse relations into a discourse graph and then use DDA-GCN to encode the semantic representation of the graph. Finally, we employ a Recurrent Neural Network to generate the summary. In addition, we utilize the question-answer discourse relation to construct a pseudo-summarization corpus, which can be used to pre-train our model.

We group two categories: generative tasks discriminative tasks. Generative tasks often formulated predicting masked tokens given context. By particularly masking words contain certain types knowledge generative pre-training, model adept memorizing completing knowledge. While discriminative tasks often formulated classification problem respect sentence tokens. By training positive negative examples constructed according external knowledge, discriminator capable verifying true false knowledge natural language.

Previous approaches are moving away from costly, resource-intensive lab settings, where collection is slow but where the data is deemed of high quality.

When voice assistant launched new locale, underlying speech processing components often developed specifically targeted country, marketplace, main language variant country. Many people assume device ``understands'' ``speaks'' specific language, example English, able work equally well English-speaking country, misunderstanding. For instance, speaker UK English asks device trained data collected United States ``tell famous football player'', highly unlikely device provide user's desired answer, since football means different things US UK cultures.

Some recent multilingual approaches NLU include, example, Convolutional Neural Network model sentence classification , Long Short-Term Memory model NER prediction . In deep neural network architecture, aforementioned NLU tasks combined single multi-task classification model. An increasing number experiments also focus multilingual setups, especially field machine translation, task translate input one language another . One recent thread multilingual research centers around learning multilingual word representation. Multilingual word embeddings shared cross-lingual vector space one main property: words different languages similar meaning must geometrically close. This property allows transfer learning one language another various multilingual tasks, dependency parsing classification NER .

However, to provide the highest accuracy and best performance for specific user populations, most existing voice assistant models are developed individually for each region or language, which requires linear investment of effort. In this paper, we propose a general multilingual model framework for Natural Language Understanding  models, which can help bootstrap new language models faster and reduce the amount of effort required to develop each language separately. We explore how different deep learning architectures affect multilingual NLU model performance. Our experimental results show that these multilingual models can reach same or better performance compared to monolingual models across language-specific test data while require less effort in creating features and model maintenance."

For example, spreading misinformation, ``Asians vulnerable novel coronavirus''~\footnote{https://www.thestar.com.my/news/regional/2020/03/11/myth-busters-10-common-rumours-about-covid-19} COVID-19 serious repercussions, making people ignore harmfulness virus directly affecting public health. Research shown misinformation spreads faster, farther, deeper, widely true information. Therefore, fake news detection social media attracted tremendous attention recently research industrial fields. Early research fake news detection mainly focused design effective features various sources, including textual content, user profiling data, news diffusion patterns. Linguistic features, writing styles sensational headlines, lexical syntactic analysis, explored separate fake news true news. Apart linguistic features, studies also proposed series user-based features, temporal features news diffusion. However, feature-based methods time-consuming, biased, require lot labor design. Besides, features easily manipulated users. To solve problems, many recent studies apply various neural networks automatically learn high-level representations fake news detection. For example, recurrent neural network , convolutional neural network , matrix factorization graph neural network applied learn representation content diffusion graph news. These methods apply types information fake news detection, paying little attention early detection. Moreover, models detect fake news consideration fixed proportion repost information, practice cannot detect fake news early stage news propagation. Some studies explore detect fake news early relying minimum number posts. The main limitation methods ignore importance publishers' users' credibility early detection fake news. When humans see piece breaking news, firstly may use common sense judge whether factual errors it. At time, also consider reputation publishers reposted users. People tend believe news trusted authoritative source news shared lots users good reputation. If publisher reliable, tend believe news. On hand, news reposted many low-reputation users short period, may spammers tried heat news, resulting lower credibility news. Inspired observation, explicitly take credibility publishers users supervised information, model fake news detection multi-task classification task. We annotate small part publishers users historical publishing reposting behaviors. Although credibility publishers users always provide correct information, necessary complementary supervised information fake news detection. To make credibility information generalized unannotated users, construct heterogeneous graph build connections publishers, news, users. Through graph-based encoding algorithm, every node graph influenced credibility publishers users. In paper, address following challenges: How fully encode heterogeneous graph structure news content; How explicitly utilize credibility publishers users facilitating early detection fake news. To tackle challenges, propose novel structure-aware multi-head attention network early detection fake news. Firstly, design structure-aware multi-head attention module learn structure publishing graph produce publisher representations credibility prediction publishers. Then, apply structure-aware multi-head attention module encode diffusion graph news among users generate user representations credibility prediction users. Finally, apply convolutional neural network map news text word embedding semantic space utilize fusion attention module combine news, publisher, user representations early fake news detection. The contributions paper summarized follows: In paper, propose framework building general multilingual NLU models, used across different marketplaces languages. To choose model best performance, use language-specific test sets evaluate candidate models corresponding baseline models along four metrics, domain accuracy, intent accuracy, slot F1, frame accuracy. The models win evaluation metrics final picks. We find models built simple multi-task biLSTM-CRF model setup comparable standard production models terms latency constraints required on-the-fly voice assistant conversational models. We observe performance improvements models introduction transfer learning. Encoder transfer produced greatest improvements whereas transfer decoder bring much change compared baseline model performance, except tested English test set, transfer learning performed model trained English data. This due fact target non-English language contains slots intents included pre-trained model, thus decoder fails predict correct classes simply missing vocabulary. To mitigate effect, decoder default initialization gives better performance embrace available slots intents target language realm. Furthermore, find model pre-trained multilingual setup performs better one trained monolingual data set.

Experimental result Hindi show multilingual model work even non-alike languages better performance improvement. This confirms common multilingual model used support multiple language better results set monolingual models. With single general multilingual NLU model, bootstrapping new languages faster use cross-lingual contextual information existing high-resource languages. At time, maintaining one model requires much less effort terms regular model updates."," The\let\thefootnote\relax\footnotetext{* Corresponding author.} dissemination of fake news significantly affects personal reputation and public trust. Recently, fake news detection has attracted tremendous attention, and previous studies mainly focused on finding clues from news content or diffusion path. However, the required features of previous models are often unavailable or insufficient in early detection scenarios, resulting in poor performance. Thus, early fake news detection remains a tough challenge. Intuitively, the news from trusted and authoritative sources or shared by many users with a good reputation is more reliable than other news. Using the credibility of publishers and users as prior weakly supervised information, we can quickly locate fake news in massive news and detect them in the early stages of dissemination.  In this paper, we propose a novel Structure-aware Multi-head Attention Network , which combines the news content, publishing, and reposting relations of publishers and users, to jointly optimize the fake news detection and credibility prediction tasks. In this way, we can explicitly exploit the credibility of publishers and users for early fake news detection. We conducted experiments on three real-world datasets, and the results show that SMAN can detect fake news in 4 hours with an accuracy of over 91\%, which is much faster than the state-of-the-art models.

To address this issue, we propose a heterogeneous graph-based model for emotional conversation generation. Specifically, we design a Heterogeneous Graph-Based Encoder to represent the conversation content  with a heterogeneous graph neural network, and then predict suitable emotions for feedback. After that, we employ an Emotion-Personality-Aware Decoder to generate a response not only relevant to the conversation context but also with appropriate emotions, by taking the encoded graph representations, the predicted emotions from the encoder and the personality of the current speaker as inputs.

"Text classification one fundamental tasks natural language processing wide applications sentiment analysis, news filtering, spam detection intent recognition. Plenty algorithms, especially deep learning-based methods, applied successfully text classification, including recurrent neural networks , convolutional networks . More recently, large pre-training language models ELMO , BERT , Xlnet also shown outstanding performance kinds NLP tasks, including text classification. Although numerous deep learning models shown success text classification problems, share learning paradigm: deep model text representation, simple classifier predict label distribution cross-entropy loss predicted probability distribution one-hot label vector. However, learning paradigm least two problems: In general text classification tasks, one-hot label representation based assumption categories independent other. But real scenarios, labels often completely independent instances may relate multiple labels, especially confused datasets similar labels. As result, simply representing true label one-hot vector fails take relations instances labels account, limits learning ability current deep learning models. The success deep learning models heavily relies large annotated data, noisy data labeling errors severely diminish classification performance, inevitable human-annotated datasets. Training one-hot label representation particularly vulnerable mislabeled samples full probability assigned wrong category. In brief, limitation current learning paradigm lead confusion prediction model hard distinguish labels, refer label confusion problem . A label smoothing method proposed remedy inefficiency one-hot vector labeling , however, still fails capture realistic relation among labels, therefore enough solve problem.

In particular, LCM learns representations labels calculates semantic similarity input text representations estimate dependency, transferred label confusion distribution . After that, original one-hot label vector added LCD controlling parameter normalized softmax function generate simulated label distribution . We use obtained SLD replace one-hot label vector supervise training model training. With help LCM, deep model capture relations instances labels, also learns overlaps among different labels, thus, performs better text classification tasks. We conclude contributions follows: We propose heterogeneous graph-based framework understand dialogue content fully perceive complex subtle emotions multi-source knowledge generate coherent emotional response. Experimental results analysis demonstrate effectiveness generalizability model, easily adapted different number knowledge sources. In future, would like infuse knowledge sources investigate various relations improve quality responses."," Representing a true label as a one-hot vector is a common practice in training text classification models. However, the one-hot representation may not adequately reflect the relation between the instances and labels, as labels are often not completely independent and instances may relate to multiple labels in practice. The inadequate one-hot representations tend to train the model to be over-confident, which may result in arbitrary prediction and model overfitting, especially for confused datasets  or noisy datasets . While training models with label smoothing  can ease this problem in some degree, it still fails to capture the realistic relation among labels. In this paper, we propose a novel Label Confusion Model  as an enhancement component to current popular text classification models. LCM can learn label confusion to capture semantic overlap among labels by calculating the similarity between instances and labels during training and generate a better label distribution to replace the original one-hot label vector, thus improving the final classification performance. Extensive experiments on five text classification benchmark datasets reveal the effectiveness of LCM for several widely used deep learning classification models. Further experiments also verify that LCM is especially helpful for confused or noisy datasets and superior to the label smoothing method."

We explore data generation in the context of two tasks, the bootstrapping of a new language and the handling of low resource features. For both tasks we explore three sequential GAN architectures, one with a token-level reward function, another with our own implementation of a token-level Monte Carlo rollout reward, and a third with sentence-level reward. We evaluate the performance of these feedback models across several sampling methodologies and compare our results to upsampling the original data to the same scale. We further improve the GAN model performance through the transfer learning of the pre-trained embeddings. Our experiments reveal synthetic data generated using the sequential generative adversarial network provides significant performance boosts across multiple metrics and can be a major benefit to the NLU tasks."

In this work, we explore strategies that improve cross-lingual transfer by bringing the multilingual embeddings closer in the semantic space.  Our first strategy augments the original English training data with machine translation-generated data. This results in a corpus of multilingual silver-labeled QA pairs that is 14 times larger than the original training set. In addition, we propose two novel strategies, language adversarial training and language arbitration framework, which significantly improve the  cross-lingual transfer performance and result in LM embeddings that are less language-variant. Empirically, we show that the proposed models outperform the previous zero-shot baseline on the recently introduced multilingual MLQA and TyDiQA  datasets."

We recast the problem of control in natural language generation as that of learning to interface with a pretrained language model to generate desired output, just as Application Programming Interfaces  control the behavior of programs by altering hyperparameters. In this new paradigm, a specialized neural network  learns to interface with a pretrained language model by manipulating the hidden activations of the pretrained model in real time to produce desired outputs, such that no permanent changes are made to the weights of the original language model.

"Language processing requires tracking information multiple timescales. To able predict final word ``timescales"" previous sentence, one must consider short-range context long-range context . How humans neural language models encode multi-scale context information? Neuroscientists developed methods study human brain encodes information multiple timescales sequence processing. By parametrically varying timescale intact context, measuring resultant changes neural response, series studies showed higher-order regions sensitive long-range context change lower-order sensory regions. These studies indicate existence ``hierarchy processing timescales"" human brain. More recently, \citet{chien2020constructing} used time-resolved method investigate brain builds shared representation, two groups people processed narrative segment preceded different contexts. By directly mapping time required individual brain regions converge shared representation response shared input, confirmed higher-order regions take longer build shared representation. Altogether, lines investigation suggest sequence processing brain supported distributed hierarchical structure: sensory regions short processing timescales primarily influenced current input short-range context, higher-order cortical regions longer timescales track longer-range dependencies . How processing timescales organized within recurrent neural networks trained perform natural language processing? Long short-term memory networks widely investigated terms ability successfully solve sequential prediction tasks. However, long-range dependencies usually studied respect particular linguistic function , less attention broader question sensitivity prior context -- broadly construed -- functionally organized within RNNs. Therefore, drawing prior work neuroscience literature, demonstrate model-free approach mapping processing timescale RNNs. We focused existing language models trained predict upcoming tokens word level character level . The timescale organization two models revealed higher layers LSTM language models contained small subset units exhibit long-range sequence dependencies; subset includes previously reported units well previously unreported units. After mapping timescales individual units, asked: processing timescales unit network relate functional role, measured connectivity? The question motivated neuroscience studies shown human brain, higher-degree nodes tend exhibit slower dynamics longer context dependence lower-degree nodes . More generally, primate brain exhibits core periphery structure relatively small number ``higher order閳 high-degree regions maintain large number connections one another, exert powerful influence large-scale cortical dynamics . Inspired relationships timescales network structure brain, set test corresponding hypotheses RNNs: Do units longer-timescales tend higher degree neural language models? Do neural language models also exhibit ``core network"" composed functionally influential high-degree units? Using exploratory network-theoretic approach, found units longer timescales tend projections units. Furthermore, identified set medium-to-long timescale ``controller"" units exhibit distinct strong projections control state units, set long-timescale ``integrator units"" showed influence predicting words long context relevant. In summary, findings advance understanding timescale distribution functional organization LSTM language models, provide method identifying important units representing long-range contextual information RNNs.

We hope work could give inspirations insights work Yelp review rating prediction based machine learning deep learning models. ----------------------------------------------------------- {\small }"," In the human brain, sequences of language input are processed within a distributed and hierarchical architecture, in which higher stages of processing encode contextual information over longer timescales. In contrast, in recurrent neural networks which perform natural language processing, we know little about how the multiple timescales of contextual information are functionally organized. Therefore, we applied tools developed in neuroscience to map the ``processing timescales闁 of individual units within a word-level LSTM language model. This timescale-mapping method assigned long timescales to units previously found to track long-range syntactic dependencies. Additionally, the mapping revealed a small subset of the network  with long timescales and whose function had not previously been explored. We next probed the functional organization of the network by examining the relationship between the processing timescale of units and their network connectivity. We identified two classes of long-timescale units: ``controller闁 units composed a densely interconnected subnetwork and strongly projected to the rest of the network, while ``integrator闁 units showed the longest timescales in the network, and expressed projection profiles closer to the mean projection profile. Ablating integrator and controller units affected model performance at different positions within a sentence, suggesting distinctive functions of these two sets of units. Finally, we tested the generalization of these results to a character-level LSTM model and models with different architectures. In summary, we demonstrated a model-free technique for mapping the timescale organization in recurrent neural networks, and we applied this method to reveal the timescale and functional organization of neural language models.\footnote{The code and dataset to reproduce the experiment can be found at \url{https://github.com/sherrychien/LSTM_timescales}}"
"We summarize contribution follows: We demonstrated new method mapping timescale organization recurrent neural language models. Using method, mapped timescale distributions units within word-level character-level LSTM language models, identified small set units long timescales. We used network analyses understand relationship timescale unit connectivity profile, distinguished two subsets long-timescale units seemingly distinctive functions. Altogether, proposed methods combining timescale connectivity analyses discovering timescale functional organization language models. The units longer processing timescales included units whose role long-range language dependencies already established , almost long timescale units unknown function. The timescale mapping procedure described provides model-free method identifying nodes necessary long-range linguistic discursive processes . Future studies neural language models could focus specific linguistic information tracked long-timescale units, especially ``controller'' units control information flow units network. The current study measured unit timescales using simple token distance, method may applied understanding recurrent neural nets beyond language models. It insightful future studies investigate whether processing timescales characterized via token distance comparable measured using functional measures, syntactic distance. Relatedly, explored timescale variance several context conditions, thorough investigation needed examine timescales individual units may vary different positions within sentence, terms token location syntactic location. Processing timescales may exhibit analogous hierarchical organization LSTMs human cerebral cortex: cases, subset nodes high degree high inter-connectivity express unusually long timescales. More detailed testing apparent correspondence required, however, units within LSTM layer spatially embedded constrained biological brains, thus LSTM units express spatially graded timescale topography. \subsubsection*{Acknowledgments} C.J.H H-Y.S.C gratefully acknowledge support National Institutes Mental Health \section{Appendix} \subsection {Units excluded timescale analysis} We excluded 1 unit WLSTM model 5 units CLSTM model properly fit using logistic function; excluded 14 units WLSTM model 7 units CLSTM model either show non-zero activation difference shared segment started, whose activation differences increased started process shared segment. After exclusions, 635 units remained WLSTM 1012 units remained CLSTM analysis. \subsection {Timescale analyses across different datasets context conditions} \subsubsection {Wikipedia test dataset} The Anna Karenina corpus used current study different linguistic structure Wikipedia corpus WLSTM CLSTM models trained. Although analyzed Anna Karenina sentences low perplexity, important test robustness results across datasets. Thus, mapped timescale unit using Wikipedia test set, used \citet{gulordava2018colorless}. Specifically, sampled 500 long sentences containing ``, and"" Intact Context condition. As before, generated sentences preceding ``shared input'' segment either original prior context segment, randomly chosen prior context segment. Same original analysis, replaced context segment 30 context segments randomly sampled parts test set generating Random Context condition. The mapped timescales using Wikipedia test set highly correlated novel corpus, suggesting robustness unit timescales . \subsubsection {Timescales measured middle sentence} To examine timescales individual units may vary across different positions sentence, varied location segmentation point. Instead using conjunction segmentation point, chose arbitrary segmentation point: 15th token long sentence, separate context segment shared input segment. In Random Context condition, replaced context segment first 15 tokens sentences corpus. We found unit timescales highly correlated condition used conjunction segmentation point several units shift timescales either directions . This analysis conducted using Wikipedia test set. \subsubsection {Timescale reset beginning sentence} To examine timescales individual units flexibly reset beginning sentence, conducted timescale analysis using ``full stop"" segmentation point instead conjunction ``, and"". Thus, original test string ``The girl kicked call, boy caught it"", full-stop version test string would ``The girl kicked ball. The boy caught it."" In setting, context segment shared input segment Intact Context condition two consecutive sentences. To ensure temporal dependence context segment shared input segment, sampled 100 consecutive sentence pairs Anna Karenina corpus. Note possible using Wikipedia test set \citet{gulordava2018colorless}, set composed unrelated sentences. The Random Context condition generated replacing first sentence randomly sampled sentences parts novel. We found using ``full stop"" segment context shared input, units network showed timescale near 0, indicating near-zero dependence linguistic context text preceding full stop . This suggests units LSTM tend ``reset"" context representation beginning sentence. \subsubsection {Context representation shaped individual words } Inspired token-shuffling procedure \citet{khandelwal2018sharp}, explored whether context representations individual units LSTM shaped individual words, rather coherent sequences words. For analysis, instead replacing context syntactically structured segments part corpus, generated ``random context"" shuffling order words within context segment. We mapped unit timescales before, examining unit activation difference function distance onset shared input. Intriguingly, found units showed similar timescales across context-replacement context-shuffling procedures . This suggests context representations LSTMs largely depend presence individual words context, rather appearance within coherent linguistic sequences. However, observe subset units whose timescales longer context replaced rather shuffled. For subset units, ability maintain representation prior context many tokens depends prior context coherent linguistic sequence. This subset units promising target future studies syntactic representations LSTMs. \subsection {Identifying strong hidden-to-gate projections} First, hidden unit, concatenated corresponding rows matrices, generate single ``hidden-to-gate"" projection vector hidden unit. Next z-scored vector get standardized projection values unit units network. Using z-score 5 criterion, identified total 258 ``strong projections"" hidden units input gate forget gate WLSTM. The projection strength unit calculated based number ""strong projections"" . Although criterion z-score selected better visualize results Figure , different criteria change results units longer timescales strong projections. For example, using z-score 3 threshold obtained corr = 0.30, p0.001; z-score 4 obtained corr = 0.35, p0.001. Next, identified edges corresponding top 258 magnitude weight-values within combined matrices. Together, edges formed ""strong-projection network"". Finally, used k-core analysis identify main core strong-projection network. This main core composed ""controller units"" . Using criteria method, identified total 390 ``strong projections"" hidden units input gate forget gate CLSTM. We extracted top 390 weight values weight matrices construct ``strong-projection network"" identified main core network, composed ``controller units"" CLSTM model \subsection {Ablation analyses putative controller integrator units} To examine non-trivial roles controller integrator units identified word-level LSTM model, performed preliminary group ablation analysis look ablating controller units influences model performance predicting next token, relative ablation random set units. Specifically, since long-timescale integrator units effect predicting tokens later part sentences , examined model performance predicting tokens two different positions: tokens regardless positions sentences , last tokens sentences . We evaluated effects ablation model performance measuring differences probabilities assigned target words . Ablation effects controller units integrator units compared baseline ablating number randomly-selected units layer 2 LSTM . We used test corpus used \citet{gulordava2018colorless} measured average performance model across 100 text-batches, randomly sampled Wikipedia test dataset. Each text-batch composed 1000 tokens start beginning sentence. In ``All tokens"" condition, calculated P every token tested text, ``Final tokens"" condition, calculated P last token every sentence . We average P conditions across text-batches get mean performance difference ablated model intact model. Ablating controller units reduced probabilities assigned target words, ablating random units . In contrast, ablating integrator units reduced probabilities less ablating random units . We hypothesized integrator units mostly influence model's prediction performance tokens long-range information especially relevant, later portions clauses sentences. Consistent this, found that, examined ablation effects tokens final position sentence, ablating integrator units reduced probabilities ablating random units . Interestingly, ablating controller units reduced probability sentence-final targets less random units . In summary, ablation results indicate non-trivial functional role controller integrator units, despite fact subset units composed 10 amongst 650 total hidden units. Also, putative controller integrator sets appear distinctive roles within WLSTM, controllers supporting accurate predictions overall, integrator units appear boost accurate predictions end sentences. \subsection {Mapping timescale organization GRU language model} \subsubsection {Training} To explore whether timescale mapping methods, findings, may generalize model architectures, trained studied word-level GRU language model . As far possible, applied similar parameters GRU used LSTM \citet{gulordava2018colorless}: Wikipedia training corpus, loss function , hyperparameters except learning rate initialized 0.1, found optimal train GRU. The GRU model also two layers, 650 hidden units layer. We trained GRU model 30 epochs, point GRU converged validation perplexity 118.36. Note since adapted similar training settings used training LSTM model Gulordava et al. without model-specific optimization, perplexity higher LSTM model reported \citet{gulordava2018colorless} . We analyzed timescale hidden units using method used analyzing LSTMs, using test data derived training Wikipedia corpus. \subsubsection {Timescale organization GRU model} Similar LSTM model Gulordova et al, majority units GRU also showed shorter timescales. More specifically, found: second layer GRU model sensitive prior context first layer, LSTM ; distribution timescales across units similar GRU LSTM, although GRU showed right-skewed distribution larger proportion short-timescale units . \subsubsection {Timescale versus network connectivity GRU model} We also performed timescale vs. network connectivity analyses GRU model. Because update hidden states GRU controlled reset update gate, measured projection patterns hidden units analyzing matrix combined hidden-to-update-gate hidden-to-reset-gate weights. In contrast LSTM models, hidden units GRU trained show relationship longer timescales stronger hidden-to-gate projections . Moreover, using k-core analysis identify subunits interconnected high-degree units, core network GRU contained many units long short timescales. Interestingly, visualized position k-core units MDS space, tended locate edge space, similar found LSTM. This indicates that, LSTM, core units GRU distinctive profiles, distant one another units network . However, observe pattern ``integrator units"" GRU LSTM. These apparent similarities differences LSTM GRU intriguing, emphasize perplexity GRU model much higher LSTM, due sub-optimal parameter settings, comparing LSTM GRU connection patterns straightforward, overall distribution weights different. Further work required determine comparable thresholds 閳ユ笩trong閳 projections 閳ユ笁igh-degree units閳 case. As noted manuscript above, connectivity results exploratory; however, believe GRU analysis demonstrates methods extended map compare functional organization language models different architecture. Finally, note conducting timescale analysis incompletely trained GRU model , timescale distribution right-skewed better-trained GRU . Altogether, results suggest long-timescale units GRU gradually formed training process. \subsection {Mapping timescale organization word-level LSTM different hidden size} To examine whether number hidden units model would affect timescale organization LSTM, trained another 2-layer word-level LSTM model Wikipedia corpus similar parameter settings \citet{gulordava2018colorless}, 100 hidden units layer. We called model LSTM-100. We trained model 56 epochs model converged validation perplexity 98.75, conducted analysis described main text map timescales LSTM-100. Because LSTM-100 overall less weight connections, use z-score 3 criteria determine ``strong"" hidden-to-gate projections connectivity analyses. Regarding timescale distribution LSTM-100, found results similar 650-unit word-level LSTM model, that: second layer LSTM-100 showed context sensitivity first layer, although difficult quantitatively compare unit-level timescale distribution LSTM-100 model LSTM 650 units, contain similarly small subset long-timescale units. . We observe significant correlation unit timescale number strong projections generated unit LSTM-100 model: long-timescale units LSTM-100 connections short-timescale units. When visualizing MDS space connectivity similarity LSTM-100, ``controller units"" identified using k-core analysis located edge space, similar 650-unit LSTM model. Interestingly, observed subset long-timescale units center MDS space, analogous ``integrator units"" found 650-unit LSTM model. Altogether, pattern ``integrator units"" might commonly evolved feature shared LSTM model architectures, GRU architectures. \counterwithin{figure}{section} \renewcommand{\thefigure}{A.\arabic{figure}} \setcounter{figure}{0} \"," Keyphrase Generation  is the task of generating central topics from a given document or literary work, which captures the crucial information necessary to understand the content. Documents such as scientific literature contain rich meta-sentence information, which represents the logical-semantic structure of the documents.  However, previous approaches ignore the constraints of document logical structure, and hence they mistakenly generate keyphrases from unimportant sentences. To address this problem, we propose a new method called Sentence Selective Network  to incorporate the meta-sentence inductive bias into KG. In SenSeNet, we use a straight-through estimator for end-to-end training and incorporate weak supervision in the training of the sentence selection module. Experimental results show that SenSeNet can consistently improve the performance of major KG models based on seq2seq framework, which demonstrate the effectiveness of capturing structural information and distinguishing the significance of sentences in KG task."

"Semantic parsing task mapping natural language utterances machine interpretable meaning representations.

"Word alignment task finding corresponding words sentence pair used key component statistical machine translation . Although word alignment longer explicitly modeled neural machine translation , often leveraged interpret analyze NMT models . Word alignment also used many scenarios, imposing lexical constraints decoding process , improving automatic post-editing providing guidance translators computer-aided translation .

However, most of them are trained with teacher forcing with the ground truth label given at each time step, without being exposed to incorrectly generated tokens during training, which hurts its generalization to unseen inputs, that is known as the ``exposure bias"" problem. In this work, we propose to mitigate the conditional text generation problem by contrasting positive pairs with negative pairs, such that the model is exposed to various valid or incorrect perturbations of the inputs, for improved generalization. However, training the model with na閼煎俥 contrastive learning framework using random non-target sequences as negative examples is suboptimal, since they are easily distinguishable from the correct output, especially so with models pretrained with large text corpora. Also, generating positive examples requires domain-specific augmentation heuristics which may not generalize over diverse domains. To tackle this problem, we propose a principled method to generate positive and negative samples for contrastive learning of seq2seq models. Specifically, we generate negative examples by adding small perturbations to the input sequence to minimize its conditional likelihood, and positive examples by adding  large perturbations while enforcing it to have a high conditional likelihood. Such ``hard'' positive and negative pairs generated using our method guides the model to better distinguish correct outputs from incorrect ones. We empirically show that our proposed method significantly improves the generalization of the seq2seq on three text generation tasks --- machine translation, text summarization, and question generation."
"Task-specific finetuning pretrained deep networks become dominant paradigm contemporary NLP, achieving state-of-the-art results across suite natural language understanding tasks .

We propose diff pruning as a simple approach to enable parameter-efficient transfer learning within the pretrain-finetune framework. This approach views finetuning as learning a task-specific ``diff"" vector that is applied on top of the pretrained parameter vector, which remains fixed and is shared across different tasks. The diff vector is adaptively pruned during training with a differentiable approximation to the $L_0$-norm penalty to encourage sparsity. Diff pruning becomes parameter-efficient as the number of tasks increases, as it requires storing only the nonzero positions and weights of the diff vector for each task, while the cost of storing the shared pretrained model remains constant. It further does not require access to all tasks during training, which makes it attractive in settings where tasks arrive in stream or the set of tasks is unknown. We find that models finetuned with diff pruning can match the performance of fully finetuned baselines on the GLUE benchmark while only modifying 0.5$\%$ of the pretrained model's parameters per task.\blfootnote{ \hspace{-6mm} Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/dguo98/DiffPruning}}"

We show that these VQ segmentation methods can be used without alteration across a wide range of tasks: unsupervised phone segmentation, ABX phone discrimination, same-different word discrimination, and as inputs to a symbolic word segmentation algorithm. The penalized method generally performs best. While results are only comparable to the state-of-the-art in some cases, in all tasks a reasonable competing approach is outperformed at a substantially lower bitrate."

A major arising problem with such websites is the proliferation of toxic comments or instances of insincerity wherein the users instead of maintaining a sincere motive indulge in spreading toxic and divisive content. The straightforward course of action in confronting this situation is detecting such content beforehand and preventing it from subsisting online. In recent times Transfer Learning in Natural Language Processing has seen an unprecedented growth. Today with the existence of transformers and various state of the art innovations, a tremendous growth has been made in various NLP domains. The introduction of BERT has caused quite a stir in the NLP community. As mentioned, when published, BERT dominated performance benchmarks and thereby inspired many other authors to experiment with it and publish similar models. This led to the development of a whole BERT-family, each member being specialized on a different task.

Readability measuring formulas, Automated Readability Index , Flesch Reading Ease , Dale閳ユ弲hall formula calculate score estimates grade level years education reader based U.S. education system, illustrated Figure . These formulas still used many widely known commercial readability measuring tools Grammarly Readable. This measurement plays significant role many places, education, health care, government . Government organizations use ensure official texts meet minimum readability requirement. For instance, Department Insurance Texas requirement insurance policy documents Flesch Reading Ease score 40 higher, translates reading level first-year undergraduate student based U.S. education system. A legal document hard read lead someone sign contract without understanding agreeing to. Another common usage area healthcare sector ensure proper readability care treatment documents . Better readability attract visitors readers different websites blogs, whereas poor readability may decrease number readers . Readability measures also often used assess financial documents annual reports company閳ユ獨 economic performance information transparent reader . Dyslexia disorder causes difficulties skills associated learning, namely reading writing, affects 20\% general population. Readability formulas applied measure difficulty reading texts people dyslexia . The scores readability formulas generally found correlate highly actual readability text written English language. The adaptation readability formulas no-English texts straightforward. Measuring readability also essential every non-English language, readability formulas mentioned language-independent. These formulas require resources like 3000-word list, easily understandable fourth-grade American students, syllable counting dictionary, stemmer, lemmatizer etc. Resource availability Natural Language Processing research obstacle low-resource-languages . In paper, aim develop readability analysis tool Bengali Language. Bengali native language Bangladesh, also used India approximately 230 million native speakers. Despite spoken language world, Bengali suffers lack fundamental resources NLP. For low resource language like Bengali, research area far considered narrow sometimes incorrect. \citet{islam2012text, sinha2012new} tried adapt formula-based approaches used English language. Unfortunately, straightforward formulas developed U.S. based education system predicts U.S. grade level reader. Since Bangladeshi education system grade levels different U.S., therefore, mapping faulty led incorrect results.

However, field NLP fast moving - excited see next transformational generation models bring.","  Determining the readability of a text is the first step to its simplification. In this paper, we present a readability analysis tool capable of analyzing text written in the Bengali language to provide in-depth information on its readability and complexity. Despite being the $7^{th}$ most spoken language in the world with 230 million native speakers, Bengali suffers from a lack of fundamental resources for natural language processing. Readability related research of the Bengali language so far can be considered to be narrow and sometimes faulty due to the lack of resources.  Therefore, we correctly adopt document-level readability formulas traditionally used for U.S. based education system to the Bengali language with a proper age-to-age comparison. Due to the unavailability of large-scale human-annotated corpora, we further divide the document-level task into sentence-level and experiment with neural architectures, which will serve as a baseline for the future works of Bengali readability prediction. During the process, we present several human-annotated corpora and dictionaries such as a document-level dataset comprising 618 documents with 12 different grade levels,  a large-scale sentence-level dataset comprising more than 96K sentences with simple and complex labels, a consonant conjunct count algorithm and a corpus of 341 words to validate the effectiveness of the algorithm, a list of 3,396 easy words, and an updated pronunciation dictionary with more than 67K words. These resources can be useful for several other tasks of this low-resource language. \footnote{We make our Code \& Dataset publicly available at \url{https://github.com/tafseer-nayeem/BengaliReadability} for reproduciblity.}"

In many scenarios, a contract is written by filling the blanks in a precompiled form. Due to carelessness, two blanks that should be filled with the same  content may be incorrectly filled with different  content. This will result in the issue of contract inconsistencies, which may severely impair the legal validity of the contract. Traditional methods to address this issue mainly rely on manual contract review, which is labor-intensive and costly. In this work, we formulate a novel Contract Inconsistency Checking  problem, and design an end-to-end framework, called Pair-wise Blank   Resolution , to solve the CIC problem with high accuracy. Our PBR model contains a novel \texttt{BlankCoder} to address the challenge of modeling meaningless blanks. \texttt{BlankCoder} adopts a two-stage attention mechanism that adequately associates a meaningless blank with its relevant descriptions while avoiding the incorporation of irrelevant context words. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets show the promising performance of our method with a balanced accuracy of $94.05\%$ and an F1 score of $90.90\%$ in the CIC problem."
"Building human-like open-domain conversational agent one milestones artificial intelligence . Early conversational agents primarily based rules , e.g., Eliza , first CA developed 60's, simulates Rogerian psychotherapist based hand-crafted pattern matching rules. In recent years, advancement data-driven neural networks, neural open-domain conversational models becoming dominant . Recent efforts open-domain neural conversational models primarily aiming improve response diversity endowing responses knowledge , personality , emotion empathy . All efforts mentioned focusing models passively respond user messages. However, many real-world scenarios, e.g., conversational recommendation, psychotherapy education, conversational agents required actively lead conversation smoothly changing conversation topic designated one. For example, casual conversation, agent may actively lead user specific product service agent wants introduce recommend. In paper, follow line research study problem imposing conversational goals/keywords open-domain conversational agents, agent required lead conversation target keyword smoothly fast. As illustrated Figure , given target keyword ``juice"" random starting keyword ``comics"", agent required converse user multiple exchanges lead conversation ``juice"". The challenge problem lies balance tradeoff maximizing keyword transition smoothness minimizing number turns taken reach target. On one hand, passively responding user solely based conversation context would achieve high smoothness may take many turns reach target, hand, directly jumping target word ignoring conversation context would minimize number turns produce non-smooth keyword transitions. \citet{tang2019target} proposed break problem two sub-problems: next-turn keyword selection keyword-augmented response retrieval. \citet{tang2019target} proposed next-turn keyword predictor rule-based keyword selection strategy solve first sub-problem, allowing agent know next keyword talk given conversation history target keyword. In addition, \citet{tang2019target} proposed keyword-augmented response retrieval model solve second sub-problem, allowing agent produce response relevant selected keyword. However, two major limitations existing studies . First, training evaluation datasets next-turn keyword prediction directly extracted conversations without human annotations, thus, majority ground-truth keyword transitions noisy low correlations human judgements. As illustrated Figure , keyword transitions conversation considered relevant. In fact, human annotation studies 600 keyword transitions, found around 70\% keyword transitions next-turn keyword prediction datasets rated relevant, renders trained next-turn keyword predictor existing studies less reliable. Second, rule-based keyword selection strategy primarily leverages cosine similarity word embeddings select keywords closer target keyword. Word embeddings trained based distributional hypothesis words similar contexts similar meanings, may reflect humans relate words conversational turn-taking. In paper, assume human conversations grounded commonsense propose keyword-guided neural conversational model leverage external commonsense knowledge graphs next-turn keyword selection keyword-augmented response retrieval. Humans rely commonsense reason, commonsense reasoning plays important role cognitive process conversational turn-taking . Relying CKG keyword transition would allow agent select target-related keyword next-turn. Moreover, leverage commonsense triplets CKG using Graph Neural Networks next-turn keyword prediction keyword-augmented response retrieval achieve accurate predictions.

In PBR, extend Transformer encoder architecture propose \texttt{BlankCoder}, off-the-shelf effective blank modeling method could easily generalize tasks text infilling. Extensive experiments show model significantly consistently outperform existing baselines, yielding promising balanced accuracy F1 score . In future, plan consider complex cases explore complex consistency checking scenarios require logical reasoning. ."," We study the problem of imposing conversational goals/keywords on open-domain conversational agents, where the agent is required to lead the conversation to a target keyword smoothly and fast. Solving this problem enables the application of conversational agents in many real-world scenarios, e.g., recommendation and psychotherapy. The dominant paradigm for tackling this problem is to 1) train a next-turn keyword classifier, and 2) train a keyword-augmented response retrieval model. However, existing approaches in this paradigm have two limitations: 1) the training and evaluation datasets for next-turn keyword classification are directly extracted from conversations without human annotations, thus, they are noisy and have low correlation with human judgements, and 2) during keyword transition, the agents solely rely on the similarities between word embeddings to move closer to the target keyword, which may not reflect how humans converse. In this paper, we assume that human conversations are grounded on commonsense and propose a keyword-guided neural conversational model that can leverage external commonsense knowledge graphs  for both keyword transition and response retrieval. Automatic evaluations suggest that commonsense improves the performance of both next-turn keyword prediction and keyword-augmented response retrieval. In addition, both self-play and human evaluations show that our model produces responses with smoother keyword transition and reaches the target keyword faster than competitive baselines."

An end-to-end  system that goes directly from speech to a hypothesis is a more attractive option. These systems were shown to be smaller, faster, and better optimized. However, they require massive amounts of end-to-end training data and in addition, don't take advantage of the already available ASR and NLU training data.  In this work, we propose an E2E system that is designed to jointly train on multiple speech-to-text tasks, such as ASR  and SLU , and text-to-text tasks, such as NLU . We call this the Audio-Text All-Task  Model and we show that it beats the performance of E2E models trained on individual tasks, especially ones trained on limited data. We show this result on an internal music dataset and two public datasets, FluentSpeech and SNIPS Audio, where we achieve state-of-the-art results.

We evaluate this ability of our model on the Facebook TOP dataset and set a new benchmark for zeroshot E2E performance. We will soon release the audio data collected for the TOP dataset for future research."

However, they often have hundreds of millions of parameters and require heavy computing resources, which limits their applications in resource-limited scenarios. Here, we propose a lightweight neural method for biomedical entity linking, which needs just a fraction of the parameters of a BERT model and much less computing resources.  Our method uses a simple alignment layer with attention mechanisms to capture the variations between mention and entity names. Yet, we show that our model is competitive with previous work on standard evaluation benchmarks."
"% background Sentence semantic matching fundamental Natural Language Processing~ task tries infer suitable label given sentence pair. For example, Natural Language Inference~ targets classifying input sentence pair one three relations~. Paraphrase Identification~ aims identifying whether input sentence pair expresses meaning.

In fact, since relations predicting targets sentence semantic matching task, methods pay enough attention relation learning. They leverage annotated labels represent relations, formulated one-hot vectors. However, independent meaningless one-hot vectors cannot reveal rich semantic information guidance relations, cause information loss. \citeauthor{gururangan2018annotation}~ observed different relations among sentence pairs imply specific semantic expressions. Taking Figure example, sentence pairs ``contradiction'' relation contain negation words~. ``entailment'' relation often leads exact numbers replaced approximates~. ``Neutral'' relation import correct irrelevant information~. Moreover, expressions sentence pairs different relations different. Therefore, comparison contrastive learning among different relations~ help models learn semantic information implied relations, turn helps strengthen sentence analysis ability models. They treated meaningless one-hot vectors. One solutions better relation utilization embedding method inspired Word2Vec. Some researchers try jointly encode input sentences labels embedding space better relation utilization sentence semantic modeling. Despite progress achieved, label embedding method requires data parameters achieve better utilization relation information.

"Discovering novel user intents important improve service quality dialogue systems. By analyzing discovered new intents, may find underlying user interests, could provide business opportunities guide improvement direction. Intent discovery attracted much attention recent years. Many researchers regard unsupervised clustering problem, manage incorporate weak supervised signals guide clustering process. For example,~\citet{hakkani-tr2013a} propose hierarchical semantic clustering model collect web page clicked information implicit supervision intent discovery.~\citet{hakkani2015clustering} utilize semantic parsing graph extra knowledge mine novel intents clustering.~\citet{Padmasundari2018} benefit consensus predictions multiple clustering techniques discover similar semantic intent-wise clusters.~\citet{haponchyk2018supervised} cluster questions user intent categories supervision structured outputs.~\citet{shi2018auto} extract intent features autoencoder automatically label intents hierarchical clustering method. However, methods fail leverage prior knowledge known intents. These methods assume unlabeled samples composed undiscovered new intents. A common case labeled data known intents accessible unlabeled data mixed known new intents. As illustrated Figure, may labeled samples known intents advance. The remaining known new intent samples unlabeled. Our goal find known intents discover new intents prior knowledge limited labeled data. Our previous work CDAC+ directly tackles problem. Nevertheless, uses pairwise similarities weak supervised signals, ambiguous distinguish mixture unlabeled known new intents. Thus, performance drops new intents. To summarize, two main difficulties task. On one hand, challenging effectively transfer prior knowledge known intents new intents limited labeled data. On hand, hard construct high-quality supervised signals learn friendly representations clustering unlabeled known new intents. To solve problems, propose effective method leverage limited prior knowledge known intents provide high-quality supervised signals feature learning. As illustrated Figure, firstly use pre-trained BERT model extract deep intent features. Then, pre-train model limited labeled data supervision softmax loss. We retain pre-trained parameters use learning information obtain well-initialized intent representations. Next, perform clustering extracted intent features estimate cluster number eliminating low-confidence clusters. As training samples unlabeled, propose original alignment strategy construct high-quality pseudo-labels supervised signals learning discriminative intent features. For training epoch, firstly perform k-means extracted intent features, use produced cluster assignments pseudo-labels training neural network. However, inconsistent assigned labels cannot directly used supervised signals, use cluster centroids targets obtain alignment mapping pseudo-labels consequent epochs. Finally, perform k-means inference. Benefit relatively consistent aligned targets, method inherit history learning information boost clustering performance. We summarize contributions follows. Firstly, propose simple effective method successfully generalizes mass new intents estimate number novel classes limited prior knowledge known intents. Secondly, propose effective alignment strategy obtain high-quality self-supervised signals learning discriminative features distinguish known new intents. Finally, extensive experiments two benchmark datasets show approach yields better robust results state-of-the-art methods.

Specifically, design R classification task help \shortname~for learning implicit common knowledge pairwise relation learning processing. Moreover, triplet loss employed constrain \shortname~for better triplet based relation learning intra-class inter-class information analyzing. Extensive experiments NLI PI tasks demonstrate superiority \shortname. In future, plan combine advantages label embedding method better sentence semantic comprehension."," 		Discovering new intents is a crucial task in dialogue systems. Most existing methods are limited in transferring the prior knowledge from known intents to new intents. They also have difficulties in providing high-quality supervised signals to learn clustering-friendly features for grouping unlabeled intents. In this work, we propose an effective method, Deep Aligned Clustering, to discover new intents with the aid of the limited known intent data. Firstly, we leverage a few labeled known intent samples as prior knowledge to pre-train the model. Then, we perform k-means to produce cluster assignments as pseudo-labels. Moreover, we propose an alignment strategy to tackle the label inconsistency problem during clustering assignments. Finally, we learn the intent representations under the supervision of the aligned pseudo-labels. With an unknown number of new intents, we predict the number of intent categories by eliminating low-confidence intent-wise clusters. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method is more robust and achieves substantial improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.

"The U.S.~NIH's precision medicine initiative calls designing treatment preventative interventions considering genetic, clinical, social, behavioral, environmental exposure variability among patients. The initiative rests widely understood finding considering individual variability critical tailoring healthcare interventions achieve substantial progress reducing disease burden worldwide. Cancer chosen near term focus eventual aim expanding conditions. As biomedical research enterprise strives fulfill initiative's goals, computing needs also rise drug discovery, predictive modeling disease onset progression, building NLP tools curate information evidence base generated. \subsection{TREC Precision Medicine Series} \end{table} In dovetailing move, U.S.~NIST's TREC running PM track since 2017 focus cancer. The goal TREC-PM task identify relevant biomedical articles clinical trials input patient case. Each case composed disease name, gene name genetic variation type, demographic information . Table shows two example cases 2019 track. So search ad hoc sense free text input facet facets highlight PM related attributes ought characterize retrieved documents. We believe style faceted retrieval going common across medical IR tasks many conditions PM initiative continues mission. \subsection{Vocabulary Mismatch Neural IR} The vocabulary mismatch problem prominent issue medical IR given large variation expression medical concepts events. For example, query ``What potential side effect Tymlos?'' drug referred brand name. Relevant scientific literature may contain generic name Abaloparatide frequently. Traditional document search engines clear limitations resolving mismatch issues. The IR community extensively explored methods address vocabulary mismatch problem, including query expansion based relevance feedback, query term re-weighting, query reconstruction optimizing query syntax. Several recent studies highlight exploiting neural network models query refinement document retrieval settings. \citet{nogueira2017task} address issue generating transformed query initial query using neural model. They use reinforcement learning train agent learns reformulate initial query maximize expected return actions . In different approach, \citet{narayan2018ranking} use RL sentence ranking extractive summarization. \subsection{Our Contributions} In paper, building BERT architecture, focus different hybrid document scoring reranking setup involving three components: .~a document relevance classification model, predicts whether document relevant given query ; .~a keyword extraction model spots tokens document likely seen PM related queries; .~an abstractive document summarization model generates pseudo-query given document context facet type via BERT encoder-decoder setup. The keywords ) pseudo-query ) together compared original query generate score. The scores components combined rerank top documents returned basic Okapi BM25 retriever Solr index corpora. %This critical neural document-query matching summarization expensive operations cannot practically scale full corpus. Our main innovation pivoting focus queries previous methods emphasis transforming candidate documents pseudo-queries via summarization. Additionally, generating pseudo-query, also let decoder output concept codes biomedical terminologies capture disease gene names. We embedding words concepts common semantic space letting decoder generate summaries include concepts. Our overall architecture evaluated using TREC-PM datasets 2019 dataset used test set. The results show absolute improvement P@10 compared prior best approaches obtaining small gain R-Prec. Qualitative analyses also highlight summarization able focus document segments highly relevant patient cases. In work, introduced effective method discovering new intents. Our method successfully transfers prior knowledge limited known intents estimates number intents eliminating low-confidence clusters. Moreover, provides stable concrete supervised signals guide clustering process. We conduct extensive experiments two challenging benchmark datasets evaluate performance. Our method achieves significant improvements compared methods obtains accurate estimated cluster numbers limited prior knowledge. In future, try different clustering methods produce supervised signals explore self-supervised methods representation learning."," Information retrieval  for precision medicine  often involves looking for multiple pieces of evidence that characterize a patient case. This typically includes at least the name of a condition and a genetic variation that applies to the patient. Other factors such as demographic attributes, comorbidities, and social determinants may also be pertinent. As such, the retrieval problem is often formulated as ad hoc search but with multiple facets  that may need to be incorporated. In this paper, we present a document reranking approach that combines neural query-document matching and text summarization toward such retrieval scenarios. Our architecture builds on the basic BERT model with three specific components for reranking: . document-query matching . keyword extraction and . facet-conditioned abstractive summarization. The outcomes of  and  are used to essentially transform a candidate document into a concise summary that can be compared with the query at hand to compute a relevance score. Component  directly generates a matching score of a candidate document for a query. The full architecture benefits from the complementary potential of document-query matching and the novel document transformation approach based on summarization along PM facets. Evaluations using NIST's TREC-PM track datasets  show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Although clarification by asking questions is a common form of human interaction, it is hard to define appropriate questions to elicit more specific intents from a user. In this work, we propose a reinforcement model to clarify ambiguous questions by suggesting refinements of the original query. We first formulate a collection partitioning problem to select a set of labels enabling us to distinguish potential unambiguous intents. We list the chosen labels as intent phrases to the user for further confirmation. The selected label along with the original user query then serves as a refined query, for which a suitable response can more easily be identified. The model is trained using reinforcement learning with a deep policy network.  We evaluate our model based on real-world user clicks and demonstrate significant improvements across several different experiments. % The ability to ask clarification questions to solve ambiguity and missing information phenomena is essential for question answering systems. The current research mainly uses questions generation or questions ranking to ask a clarification question, which lead to low success rate and redundant information. Insufficient use of the graphic user interface  results in more interactions with users. There is usually no guarantee for replying the user after the clarification. To solve these problems, we propose a question clarification method based on intents recommendation. intents are extracted from the historical Frequently Asked Questions of our system. The recommended intents can provide more concise candidates for user to click. Once an intent is clicked, the system guaranteed to provide a clear question list relative to the real question. We use the reinforcement learning method to recommend intents, and the most challenging problem is cold start. The reward is designed to recommend the most relevant clear question list and maximize the information gain after clicking one intent for better question clarification. The method we proposed for question clarification can solve both ambiguity and missing information phenomena. Experiments on interactions with more than 100 million real-world online users shows the effectiveness of this method."
"%Discourse Parsing key NLP %an important task, aiming establish better understanding multi-sentential natural language. %, inherently ambiguous intent-driven. %Most research area thereby focuses one two main discourse theories RST PDTB , proposed decade ago.

While methods for incorporating discourse become more and more sophisticated, the growing need for robust and general discourse structures has not been sufficiently met by current discourse parsers, usually trained on small scale datasets in a strictly limited number of domains. This makes the prediction for arbitrary tasks noisy and unreliable. The overall resulting lack of high-quality, high-quantity discourse trees poses a severe limitation to further progress.  In order the alleviate this shortcoming, we propose a new strategy to generate tree structures in a task-agnostic, unsupervised fashion by extending a latent tree induction framework with an auto-encoding objective. The proposed approach can be applied to any tree-structured objective, such as syntactic parsing, discourse parsing and others. However, due to the especially difficult annotation process to generate discourse trees, we initially develop a method to generate larger and more diverse discourse treebanks. In this paper we are inferring general tree structures of natural text in multiple domains, showing promising results on a diverse set of tasks.  %With this paper, we intend to initiate a new line of research on inferring discourse structures in an unbiased manner. %With a growing need for robust and general discourse structures in many downstream tasks and real-world applications, the current lack of high-quality, high-quantity discourse trees poses a severe shortcoming. %In order the alleviate this limitation, we propose a new strategy to generate tree structures in a task-agnostic, unsupervised fashion by extending a latent tree induction framework with an auto-encoding objective.

Coarse-grained selection is a basic module in a retrieval-based chatbot,   which constructs a rough candidate set from the whole database to speed up the interaction with customers.   So far, there are two kinds of approaches for coarse-grained selection module:     sparse representation;  dense representation.   To the best of our knowledge, there is no systematic comparison between these two approaches in retrieval-based chatbots,   and which kind of method is better in real scenarios is still an open question.   In this paper, we first systematically compare these two methods from four aspects:     effectiveness;  index stoarge;  search time cost;  human evaluation.   Extensive experiment results demonstrate that dense representation method    significantly outperforms the sparse representation,    but costs more time and storage occupation.   In order to overcome these fatal weaknesses of dense representation method,    we propose an ultra-fast, low-storage, and highly effective    Deep Semantic Hashing Coarse-grained selection method, called DSHC model.   Specifically, in our proposed DSHC model,   a hashing optimizing module that consists of two autoencoder models is    stacked on a trained dense representation model,   and three loss functions are designed to optimize it.   The hash codes provided by hashing optimizing module effectively    preserve the rich semantic and similarity information in dense vectors.   Extensive experiment results prove that,   our proposed DSHC model can achieve much faster speed and lower storage than sparse representation,   with limited performance loss compared with dense representation.   Besides, our source codes have been publicly released for future research\footnote{\url{https://github.com/gmftbyGMFTBY/HashRetrieval}}."

The 闁炽儲绗old standard闁 training data for NER systems provide annotation for each token of the text with the corresponding entity or non-entity label. We work with only partially complete training data, which differ from the gold standard NER data in that the exact location of the entities in the text is unknown and the entities may contain typos and/or OCR mistakes. To overcome the challenges of our noisy training data, e.g. text extraction errors and/or typos and unknown label indices, we formulate the NER task as a text-to-text sequence generation task and train a pointer generator network to generate the entities in the document rather than label them. We show that the pointer generator can be effective for NER in the absence of gold standard data and outperforms the common NER neural network architectures in long legal documents."
"Speech translation~, translates audio signals speech one language text foreign language, hot research subject nowadays widespread applications, like cross-language videoconferencing customer support chats. Traditionally, researchers build speech translation system via cascading manner, including automatic speech recognition~ machine translation~ subsystem.

"Query reformulation paraphrase generation techniques employed variety purposes natural language processing , dialogue generation , machine translation , especially question answering systems . Generating coherent clean texts reduce potential errors downstream systems. In cases users receiving end NLP pipelines, essential show fluent human-like languages lose faith recede requiring human agents sake better understanding communication. In search question answering systems, query reformulation aims paraphrase restructure original question sequences, transforming ones interpretable natural well-formedness grammar semantics. Typically, users may patience input entirely grammatical coherent question, cause issues downstream components understand give accurate predictions answers. When human representatives present, originally noisy query question reiterated rephrased double-check users asking for. This costly operation every convoluted question needs restated.

In this process, it is also crucial to maintain and even enhance performance in a downstream environments like question answering when rephrased queries are given as input. We explore methods to generate these query reformulations by training reformulators using text-to-text transformers and apply policy-based reinforcement learning algorithms to further encourage reward learning. Query fluency is numerically evaluated by the same class of model fine-tuned on a human-evaluated well-formedness dataset. The reformulator leverages linguistic knowledge obtained from transfer learning and generates more well-formed reformulations than a translation-based model in qualitative and quantitative analysis. During reinforcement learning, it better retains fluency while optimizing the RL objective to acquire question answering rewards and can generalize to out-of-sample textual data in qualitative evaluations. Our RL framework is demonstrated to be flexible, allowing reward signals to be sourced from different downstream environments such as intent classification."
"Identifying user's open intent plays significant role dialogue systems. As shown Figure, two known intents specific purposes, book flight restaurant reservation. However, also utterances irrelevant unsupported intents system cannot handle. It necessary distinguish utterances known intents much possible. On one hand, effectively identifying open intent improve customer satisfaction reducing false-positive error. On hand, use open intent discover potential user needs.

However, fail capture high-level semantic concepts SVM. ~\citet{bendale2016towards} manage reduce open space risk deep neural networks , need sample open classes selecting core hyperparameters.~\citet{hendrycks17baseline} use softmax probability confidence score, also need select confidence threshold negative samples.~\citet{Shu2017DOCDO} replace softmax sigmoid activation function, calculate confidence thresholds class based statistics. However, statistics-based thresholds learn essential differences known classes open class.~\citet{lin-xu-2019-deep} propose learn deep intent features margin loss detect unknown intents local outlier factor. However, specific decision boundaries distinguishing open intent, needs model architecture modification. Most existing methods need design specific classifiers identifying open class perform poorly common classifier. Moreover, performance open classification largely depends decision conditions. Most methods need negative samples determining suitable decision conditions. It also complicated time-consuming process manually select optimal decision condition, applicable real scenarios. To solve problems, use known intents prior knowledge, propose novel post-processing method learn adaptive decision boundary open intent classification. As illustrated Figure, first extract intent representations BERT model. Then, pre-train model supervision softmax loss. We define centroids known class suppose known intent features constrained closed ball areas. Next, aim learn radius ball area obtain decision boundaries. Specifically, initialize boundary parameters standard normal distribution use learnable activation function projection get radius decision boundary. The suitable decision boundaries satisfy two conditions. On one hand, broad enough surround in-domain samples much possible. On hand, need tight enough prevent out-of-domain samples identified in-domain samples. To address issues, propose new loss function, optimizes boundary parameters balancing open space risk empirical risk. The decision boundaries automatically learn adapt intent feature space balance boundary loss. We find post-processing method still learn discriminative decision boundaries detect open intent even without modifying original model architecture. We summarize contribution follows. Firstly, propose novel post-processing method open classification, need prior knowledge open class. Secondly, propose new loss function automatically learn tight decision boundaries adaptive feature space.

On the one hand, we should ensure the classification quality of known intents. On the other hand, we need to identify the open  intent during testing. Current models are limited in finding the appropriate decision boundary to balance the performances of both known and open intents. In this paper, we propose a post-processing method to learn the adaptive decision boundary  for open intent classification. We first utilize the labeled known intent samples to pre-train the model. Then, we use the well-trained features to automatically learn the adaptive spherical decision boundaries for each known intent. Specifically, we propose a new loss function to balance both the empirical risk and the open space risk. Our method does not need open samples and is free from modifying the model architecture. We find our approach is surprisingly insensitive with less labeled data and fewer known intents. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our method yields significant improvements compared with the state-of-the-art methods.\footnote{Code: https://github.com/thuiar/Adaptive-Decision-Boundary}"

The error analysis indicates that, cases, models miss columns synthesizing target SQL, column mentioned explicitly utterance. The model fails infer columns implicitly cell values. This problem trickier first one, model expected infer column name based cell values mentioned utterance, instead matching utterance tokens schema. This requires model domain knowledge. For example, presented second section Table, model know . The model learn compose complex queries. Besides column selection, generate correct SQL, model learn attach selected columns correct clauses.

However, based on a pilot study, we observe three issues of existing general-purpose language models when they are applied to text-to-SQL semantic parsers: fail to detect column mentions in the utterances, fail to infer column mentions from cell values, and fail to compose complex SQL queries. To mitigate these issues, we present a model pre-training framework, Generation-Augmented Pre-training~, that jointly learns representations of natural language utterances and table schemas by leveraging generation models to generate pre-train data. \modelnamelm\footnote{This refers to the language models that are pre-trained with GAP framework.} is trained on 2M utterance-schema pairs and 30K utterance-schema-SQL triples, whose utterances are produced by generative models. Based on experimental results, neural semantic parsers that leverage \modelnamelm~as a representation encoder obtain new state-of-the-art results on both Spider and Criteria-to-SQL benchmarks."
"Neural Machine Translation yields state-of-the-art translation performance large number parallel sentences available. However, parallel corpora available majority language pairs domains.

"As important task dialogue system, response selection aims find best matched response set candidates given context conversation. The retrieved responses usually natural, fluent diverse expressions rich information owing abundant resources. Therefore, response selection widely used industry attracted great attention academia. Most existing studies task pay attention matching problem utterances responses, insufficient concern reasoning issue multi-turn response selection. Just recently, MuTual, first human-labeled reasoning-based dataset multi-turn dialogue, released promote line research. Reasoning quite different matching conversations. Specifically, matching focuses capturing relevance features utterances responses, reasoning needs identify key features , also needs conduct inference based clue words. The challenges new task include: identify clue words utterances, fundamental inference; conduct inference according clue words utterances. Figure illustrates motivating example. To infer current time, must first identify clue words `10:45' `15 minutes' . Then must conduct logical inference based clue words . To tackle challenges, first, need better contextual representation identifying clue words conversations. This clue word identification inevitably relies context conversation. Although previous literature publications achieved promising results context modeling, still several limitations approaches. More concretely, existing studies either concatenate utterances form context process utterance independently, leading loss dependency relationships among utterances important contextual information. It validated chronological dependency utterances, well semantical dependency utterances, crucial multi-turn response selection.

GRN first conducts pre-training based on ALBERT using next utterance prediction and utterance order prediction tasks specifically devised for response selection. These two customized pre-training tasks can endow our model with the ability of capturing semantical and chronological dependency between utterances.

The sequence reasoning module conducts inference based on the highly summarized context vector of utterance-response pairs from the global perspective. The graph reasoning module conducts the reasoning on the utterance-level graph neural network from the local perspective.

However, approach readily adapted implicit discourse relations determination, requires high-order features semantic information. Moreover, compensate lack large-scale corpora, prior work neural modeling leveraged inductive biases syntactic features part-of-speech tagging improve performance. However, models still suffer insufficient linguistics information lack data, thus incapable acquiring deeper richer contextual representations useful discourse processing.

Challenges include the deep structure of document-level discourse trees, the requirement of subtle semantic judgments, and the lack of large-scale training corpora. To address such challenges, we propose to exploit robust representations derived from multiple levels of granularity across syntax and semantics, and in turn incorporate such representations in an end-to-end encoder-decoder neural architecture for more resourceful discourse processing. In particular, we first use a pre-trained contextual language model that embodies high-order and long-range dependency to enable finer-grain semantic, syntactic, and organizational representations. We further encode such representations with boundary and hierarchical information to obtain more refined modeling for document-level discourse processing.

Knowledge-grounded response generation requests give response automatically model using dialogue history unstructured knowledge input. There two different types dialogue systems, retrieval-based system, generation-based system. Retrieval-based dialogue system, giving responses list candidate sentences, fixed answer forms candidate sets. To deal problem, needs flexible natural responses, generation-based model better choice. Dialogue generation requires encoder represent input decoder generate response. The network often needs minimize cross-entropy loss output ground truth. In paper, use latent variable encode dialog history selected knowledge better generate responses combined copy mechanism. % Pre-trained language models make great progress dialogue generation.

This challenge can be separated into three subtasks,  knowledge-seeking turn detection,  knowledge selection, and  knowledge-grounded response generation. We use pre-trained language models, ELECTRA and RoBERTa, as our base encoder for different subtasks. For subtask 1 and 2, the coarse-grained information like domain and entity are used to enhance knowledge usage. For subtask 3, we use a latent variable to encode dialog history and selected knowledge better and generate responses combined with copy mechanism. Meanwhile, some useful post-processing strategies are performed on the model's final output to make further knowledge usage in the generation task.  As shown in released evaluation results, our proposed system ranks second under objective metrics and ranks fourth under human metrics."

"Medical dialogue system aims converse patients inquire additional symptoms beyond self-reports make diagnosis automatically, gained increasing attention . It significant potential simplify diagnostic process relieve cost collecting information patients . Moreover, preliminary diagnosis reports generated MDS may assist doctors make diagnosis efficiently. Because considerable benefits, many researchers devote substantial efforts address critical sub-problems MDS, natural language understanding , dialogue policy learning, dialogue management, make promising progress build satisfactory MDS. Medical dialogue generation , generates responses natural language request additional symptoms make diagnosis, critical MDS rarely studied. Conventional generative dialogue models often employ neural sequence modeling cannot applied medical dialogue scenario directly absence medical knowledge. Recently, large-scale pre-training language models unsupervised corpora achieved significant success. However, fine-tuning large language models medical domain requires sufficient task-specific data learn correlations diseases symptoms. Unfortunately, depicted Fig., large portion diseases instances practice, means newly-coming diseases realistic diagnosis scenario often low-resource conditions. Therefore, highly desirable transfer diagnostic experience high-resource diseases others data scarcity. Besides, existing knowledge-grounded approaches may fail perform transfer well, learn one unified model diseases ignore specificity relationships different diseases. Finally, practice, disease-symptom relations disease may vary evolve along cases, also considered prior works. Contributions. To address challenges, first propose end-to-end dialogue system low-resource medical dialogue generation. This model integrates three components seamlessly, hierarchical context encoder, meta-knowledge graph reasoning network graph-guided response generator. Among them, context encoder encodes conversation hierarchical representations. For MGR, mainly contains parameterized meta-knowledge graph, initialized prior commonsense graph characterizes correlations among diseases symptoms. When fed context information, MGR adaptively evolve meta-knowledge graph reason disease-symptom correlations predict related symptoms patient next response determine disease. Finally, response generator generates response symptoms request guidance meta-knowledge graph. The second contribution develop novel Graph-Evolving Meta-Learning framework transfer diagnostic experience low-resource scenario. Firstly, GEML trains medical dialogue model meta-learning framework. It regards generating responses handful dialogues task learns meta-initialization dialogue model fast adapt task new disease limited dialogues. In way, learnt model initialization contains sufficient meta-knowledge\footnote{We name knowledge ``meta-knowledge"" since obtained meta-training different source diseases.} source diseases serve good model initialization quickly transfer meta-knowledge new disease. More importantly, GEML also learns good parameterized meta-knowledge graph MGR module characterize disease-symptom relationships source diseases. Concretely, meta learning framework, disease, GEML enriches meta-knowledge graph via constructing global-symptom graph online dialogue examples. In way, learnt meta-knowledge graph bridge gap commonsense medical graph real diagnostic dialogues thus fast evolved new target disease. Thanks graph evolving, dialogue model request patients underlying symptoms efficiently thus improve diagnostic accuracy. Besides, GEML also well address real-world challenge disease-symptom correlations could vary along cases, since meta-knowledge graph trainable based collected dialogue examples. Finally, construct large medical dialogue dataset, called Chunyu\footnote{Code dataset released https://github.com/ha-lins/GEML-MDG.}. It covers 15 kinds diseases 12,842 dialogue examples totally, much larger existing CMDD medical dialogue dataset. The challenging benchmark better comprehensively evaluate performance medical dialogue systems. Extensive experimental results datasets demonstrate superiority method state-of-the-arts. In work, propose simple effective approach COVID-19 fake news detection based CT-BERT ensembling learning. Our experiments confirmed BERT-based models specialized subject area successfully cope tasks perform high-quality binary classification. The experimental results showed solution achieved 98.69\ weighted F1-score test data ranked first place Constraint@-AAAI2021 shared task. For future work, experiment different training data augmentation techniques. We also apply evaluate hybrid models combining BERT-based architectures methods natural language processing . ---- Bibliography ---- BibTeX users specify bibliography style 'splncs04'. References sorted formatted correct style.","  	 	Human doctors with well-structured medical knowledge can diagnose a disease merely via a few conversations with patients about symptoms. In contrast, existing knowledge-grounded dialogue systems often require a large number of dialogue instances to learn as they fail to capture the correlations between different diseases and neglect the diagnostic experience shared among them. To address this issue, we propose a more natural and practical paradigm, i.e., low-resource medical dialogue generation, which can transfer the diagnostic experience from source diseases to target ones with a handful of data for adaptation. It is capitalized on a commonsense knowledge graph to characterize the prior disease-symptom relations.  	Besides, we develop a Graph-Evolving Meta-Learning  framework that learns to evolve the commonsense graph for reasoning disease-symptom correlations in a new disease, which effectively alleviates the needs of a large number of dialogues. More importantly, by dynamically evolving disease-symptom graphs, GEML also well addresses the real-world challenges that the disease-symptom correlations of each disease may vary or evolve along with more diagnostic cases. Extensive experiment results on the CMDD dataset and our newly-collected Chunyu dataset testify the superiority of our approach  over state-of-the-art approaches.  	Besides, our GEML can generate an enriched dialogue-sensitive knowledge graph in an online manner, which could benefit other tasks grounded on knowledge graph."

Further interpretability analysis of source embeddings and the attention shows that, in the Language-Specific case, the embeddings encode more gender information, and its attention is more diverted.

"Commonsense question answering recently attractive field requires systems understand common sense information beyond words, normal human beings nontrivial machines. There plenty datasets proposed purpose, instance, CommonsenseQA , CosmosQA , WIQA . Different traditional machine reading comprehension tasks SQuAD NewsQA key information answering questions directly given context paragraph, solving commonsense questions requires comprehensive understanding context relevant common knowledge, reasoning hidden logic them. There varieties knowledge bases meet need, including text corpora like Wikipedia, large-scale knowledge graphs . Recent popular solution resorts external supporting facts knowledge bases evidence, enhance question commonsense knowledge logic reasoning . However, quality supporting facts guaranteed, weak interpretability help question answering. Specifically, current methods mainly two-fold. The first group methods pre-train language models external supporting facts models could remember common knowledge, empirically proven Tandon et al. \shortcite{tandon2019wiqa} Trinh Le \shortcite{trinh2018do}. The second group methods incorporates question knowledge subgraphs paths carry information relation among concepts show multi-hop reasoning process. The structured information typically encoded via graph models GCN , merged question features. Generally, current methods handle evidence brute force, without selection refinement according interpretability supporting facts. But example shown Figure, supporting facts interpret question, regardless semantically related. Thus, need models processing evidence. In paper, introduce new recursive erasure memory network refines candidate supporting fact set. The REM-Net consists three main components: query encoder, evidence generator, novel recursive erasure memory module. Specifically, query encoder pre-trained encoder encodes question. The evidence generator pre-trained generative model produces candidate supporting facts based question. Compared retrieved supporting facts, generated facts provides new question-specific information beyond existing knowledge bases. The REM module refines candidate supporting fact set recursively matching supporting facts question feature space estimate fact's quality. This estimation helps updating question feature supporting fact set. The question feature updated residual term, whereas supporting fact set updated removing low-quality facts. Compared standard attention mechanisms allocate weights supporting facts once, multi-hop operation REM module widens gap much supporting fact contributes question answering number recursive steps features incorporated feature update. Therefore procedure leads refined use given supporting facts. We conduct experiments two commonsense QA benchmarks, WIQA CosmosQA . The experimental results demonstrate REM-Net outperforms current methods, refined supporting facts qualified questions. Our contributions mainly three-fold: This paper shows MNMT architecture impact gender accuracy. Language-Specific outperforms Shared two different language sets: English, German, Spanish, French English, German, Spanish, French, Russian. We observe difference gender accuracy higher language set including Russian. Further interpretability analysis results shows source embeddings Language-Specific architecture retain higher information gender. Moreover, architecture also keeps enough diversion attention, especially including Russian. Both elements help better inferring correct gender. Finally, manual analysis shows errors made assuming masculine occupation instead feminine one. In contrast, inverse error tends come feminine version word another meaning."," When answering a question, people often draw upon their rich world knowledge in addition to the particular context. While recent works retrieve supporting facts/evidence from commonsense knowledge bases to supply additional information to each question, there is still ample opportunity to advance it on the quality of the evidence. It is crucial since the quality of the evidence is the key to answering commonsense questions, and even determines the upper bound on the QA systems' performance. In this paper, we propose a recursive erasure memory network  to cope with the quality improvement of evidence. To address this, REM-Net is equipped with a module to refine the evidence by recursively erasing the low-quality evidence that does not explain the question answering. Besides, instead of retrieving evidence from existing knowledge bases, REM-Net leverages a pre-trained generative model to generate candidate evidence customized for the question. We conduct experiments on two commonsense question answering datasets, WIQA and CosmosQA. The results demonstrate the performance of REM-Net and show that the refined evidence is explainable."

The experimental results on several benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method. Our compressed model is $8\times$ shallower than the deep model, with almost no loss in BLEU. To further enhance the teacher model, we present a Skipping Sub-Layer method to randomly omit sub-layers to introduce perturbation into training, which achieves a BLEU score of 30.63 on English-German newstest2014.

Recent researches depicted that the effective use of syntax can improve SRL performance. However, syntax is a complicated linguistic clue and is hard to be effectively applied in a downstream task like SRL. This work effectively encodes syntax using adaptive convolution which endows strong flexibility to existing convolutional networks. The existing CNNs may help in encoding a complicated structure like syntax for SRL, but it still has shortcomings. Contrary to traditional convolutional networks that use same filters for different inputs, adaptive convolution uses adaptively generated filters conditioned on syntactically-informed inputs. We achieve this with the integration of a filter generation network which generates the input specific filters. This helps the model to focus on important syntactic features present inside the input, thus enlarging the gap between syntax-aware and syntax-agnostic SRL systems. We further study a hashing technique to compress the size of the filter generation network for SRL in terms of trainable parameters. Experiments on CoNLL-2009 dataset confirm that the proposed model substantially outperforms most previous SRL systems for both English and Chinese languages."
"Learning dialogue policies typically formulated reinforcement learning problem . However, dialogue policy learning via RL scratch real-world dialogue scenarios expensive time-consuming, requires real users interact adjusts policies online . A plausible strategy use user simulators inexpensive alternative real users, randomly sample user goal user goal set dialogue agent training . In task-oriented dialogue settings, entire conversation revolves around sampled user goal implicitly. Nevertheless, dialogue agent's objective help user accomplish goal even though agent knows nothing sampled user goal , shown Figure. The randomly sampling-based user simulator neglects fact human learning supervision often accompanied curriculum . For instance, human-teacher teaches students, order presented examples random meaningful, students benefit . Therefore, randomly sampling-based user simulators bring two issues: Most previous studies dialogue policy focused efficiency issue, reward shaping , companion learning , incorporate planning , etc. However, stability pre-requisite method work well real-world scenarios. It because, matter effective algorithm is, unstable online leaned policy may ineffective applied real dialogue environment. This lead bad user experience thus fail attract sufficient real users continuously improve policy. As far know, little work reported stability dialogue policy. Therefore, essential address stability issue. In paper, propose novel policy learning framework combines curriculum learning deep reinforcement learning, namely Automatic Curriculum Learning-based Deep Q-Network . As shown Figure, framework replaces traditional random sampling method user simulator teacher policy model arranges meaningful ordered curriculum dynamically adjusts help dialogue agent automatic curriculum learning. As scheduling controller student agents, teacher policy model arranges students learn different user goals different learning stages without requirement prior knowledge. Sampling user goals match ability student agents regarding different difficulty user goal, increases feedback environment student agent also makes learning student agent stable. There two criteria evaluating sampling order user goal: learning progress student agent over-repetition penalty. The learning progress student agent emphasizes efficiency user goal, encouraging teacher policy model choose user goals match ability student agent maximize learning efficiency student agent. The over-repetition penalty emphasizes sampled diversity, preventing teacher policy model cheating\footnote[1]{The teacher policy model repeatedly selects user goals student agent mastered obtain positive rewards.}. The incorporation learning progress student agent over-repetition penalty reflects sampled efficiency sampled diversity improve efficiency well stability ACL-DQN. Additionally, proposed ACL-DQN framework equip different curriculum schedules. Hence, order verify generalization proposed framework, propose three curriculum schedule standards framework experimentation: i) Curriculum schedule A: standard, single teacher model; ii) Curriculum schedule B: user goals sampled easiness hardness proportion; iii) Curriculum schedule C: ensure student agents mastered simpler goals learning complex goals. Experiments demonstrated ACL-DQN significantly improves dialogue policy automatic curriculum learning achieves better stable performance DQN. Moreover, ACL-DQN equipped curriculum schedules improved. Among three curriculum schedules provided, ACL-DQN curriculum schedule C strength supervision controllability, better follow learning progress students performs best. In summary, contributions follows: This paper presents neural framework semantic role labeling, effectively incorporating filter generation network extract important syntactic features encoded BiLSTM Tree-LSTM generating filters conditioned inputs. The adaptive convolution endows flexibility existing convolution operations. With extraction important syntax information, able enlarge gap syntax aware syntax agnostic SRL systems. We study hashing technique drastically decreases size filter generation network. Lastly, explore effects syntax quality SRL systems conclude high quality syntax improve SRL performance. Experiments CoNLL-2009 dataset validate proposed model outperforms previous SRL systems English Chinese languages."," Dialogue policy learning based on reinforcement learning is difficult to be applied to real users to train dialogue agents from scratch because of the high cost. User simulators, which choose random user goals for the dialogue agent to train on, have been considered as an affordable substitute for real users. However, this random sampling method ignores the law of human learning, making the learned dialogue policy inefficient and unstable. We propose a novel framework, Automatic Curriculum Learning-based Deep Q-Network , which replaces the traditional random sampling method with a teacher policy model to realize the dialogue policy for automatic curriculum learning. The teacher model arranges a meaningful ordered curriculum and automatically adjusts it by monitoring the learning progress of the dialogue agent and the over-repetition penalty without any requirement of prior knowledge. The learning progress of the dialogue agent reflects the relationship between the dialogue agent's ability and the sampled goals' difficulty for sample efficiency. The over-repetition penalty guarantees the sampled diversity. Experiments show that the ACL-DQN significantly improves the effectiveness and stability of dialogue tasks with a statistically significant margin. Furthermore, the framework can be further improved by equipping with different curriculum schedules, which demonstrates that the framework has strong generalizability."

"Self attention networks widely studied many natural language processing tasks, machine translation , language modeling natural language inference . It well accepted SANs leverage local long-term dependencies attention mechanism, highly parallelizable thanks position-independent modeling method. However, position-independent models incapable explicitly capturing boundaries sequences words, thus overlook structure information proven robust inductive biases modeling texts . Unlike RNNs model sequential structure information words using memory cells, CNNs focus learning local structure dependency words via convolution kernels, SANs learn flexible structural information indirect way almost scratch. One way integrate structural information SAN models via pre-training, BERT , learns represent sentences using unsupervised learning tasks large-scale corpus. Recent studies shown ability pre-training models capturing structure information sentences. Another method deal structural information introducing structure priors SANs mask strategies. \citeauthor{shen2018disan} \shortcite{shen2018disan} proposed directional self-attention mechanism, employs two SANs forward backward masks respectively encode temporal order information. \citeauthor{guo2019gaussian} \shortcite{guo2019gaussian} introduced Gaussian prior transformers capturing local compositionality words. Admittedly, structure priors strengthen model's capability modeling sentences meanwhile assist capturing proper dependencies. With help learned structure priors, SANs model sentences accurately even resource-constrained conditions. Though models get success many NLP tasks, studies commonly focus integrating one single type structure priors SANs, thus fail making full use multi-head attentions. One straightforward advantage using multi-head attentions lies fact different heads convey different views texts . In words, multi-head attentions enable model capture information texts multiple aspects, return brings thorough views modeling texts. Besides, well accepted one type structural prior reveal part structural information one single perspective. A variety types structural priors needed order gain complete structural information texts. This achieved introducing different structural priors different parts attention heads, different structural priors complement other, guiding SAN models learn proper dependencies words. Therefore, gain better representation texts, desirable solution make full use multi-head attention mechanism utilize multiple types structural priors. To better alleviate aforementioned problems, paper, propose lightweight self attention network, i.e., Multiple Structural Priors Guided Self Attention Network . The novel idea behind model lies usage multi-mask based multi-head attention , helps model better capture different types dependencies texts. Thanks MM-MH Attention mechanism, model capture multiple structural priors, return brings benefits modeling sentences. Especially, structural priors employed come two categories: sequential order relative position words. Since standard SANs incapable distinguishing order words, apply direction mask directly attention head. Motivated Bidirectional RNNs , split attention heads two parts. For given word, apply forward mask first half attention heads, allows attend previous words modeling reference word. Accordingly, backward mask applied rest attention heads. Since direction masks take consideration difference long-distance words nearby words, employ second category structural prior complement, could measured distance pair words. We integrate two types distance masks different attention heads. The first one utilized word distance mask, describes physical distance pair words. Besides, purpose capturing latent hierarchical structure sentences, integrate another kind distance information, i.e., dependency distance defined distance pair words dependency syntax tree. The word distance mask helps model focus local words dependency distance mask enables model capture hierarchical relationships words. Consequently, provide model ability capturing local non-local dependency words properly.

However, it is still not entirely clear why and when EncoderFusion should work. In this paper, our main contribution is to take a step further in understanding EncoderFusion. Many of previous studies believe that the success of EncoderFusion comes from exploiting surface and syntactic information embedded in lower encoder layers. Unlike them, we find that the encoder embedding layer is more important than other intermediate encoder layers.  In addition, the uppermost decoder layer consistently pays more attention to the encoder embedding layer across NLP tasks. Based on this observation, we propose a simple fusion method, SurfaceFusion, by fusing only the encoder embedding layer for the softmax layer. Experimental results show that SurfaceFusion outperforms EncoderFusion on several NLP benchmarks, including machine translation, text summarization, and grammatical error correction.   It obtains the state-of-the-art performance on WMT16 Romanian-English and WMT14 English-French translation tasks. Extensive analyses reveal that SurfaceFusion learns more expressive bilingual word embeddings by building a closer relationship between relevant source and target embeddings. Source code is freely available at \url{https://github.com/SunbowLiu/SurfaceFusion}.  \iffalse To model the inter-dependence of two sequences, sequence-to-sequence  learning extracts the source surface and abstract features through its encoder output representations. However, an overloaded use of the encoder output representations might lead to an insufficient representation capacity, which we call it source representation bottleneck. Recent studies have found that widening the bottleneck by fusing the surface features from lower level representations can boost the performance of Seq2Seq, but none of them explain the intrinsic mechanism of this benefit. In this paper, we take the first step to probe into the essence of the bottleneck on three typical Seq2Seq tasks, i.e.~machine translation, text summarization, and grammatical error correction. We observe that the representation learning of higher decoder layer suffers from the bottleneck, and thus propose a simple yet effective surface fusion method to mitigate the issue. The results over a variety of benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. Source code will be released. \fi"

They can only utilize single-modal data  or limited multi-modal data . In this work, we propose a unified-modal pre-training architecture, namely UNIMO, which can effectively adapt to both single-modal and multi-modal understanding and generation tasks. Large scale of free text corpus and image collections can be utilized to improve the capability of visual and textual understanding, and cross-modal contrastive learning  is leveraged to align the textual and visual information into a unified semantic space over a corpus of image-text pairs. As the non-paired single-modal data is very rich, our model can utilize much larger scale of data to learn more generalizable representations. Moreover, the textual knowledge and visual knowledge can enhance each other in the unified semantic space. The experimental results show that UNIMO significantly improves the performance of several single-modal and multi-modal downstream tasks."
"Although 7,000 languages spoken worldwide~, several dozen enough data available support supervised speech recognition, many languages even employ writing system~.

We conduct experiments on the Flickr8k spoken caption dataset in addition to a novel corpus of spoken audio captions collected for the popular MSCOCO dataset, demonstrating that our generated captions also capture diverse visual semantics of the images they describe. We investigate several different intermediate speech representations, and empirically find that the representation must satisfy several important properties to serve as drop-in replacements for text."

To do so, the teacher translates text from source-language to target-language, which are then combined into a dataset for student.   We explore two types of monolingual data that can be included in knowledge distillation training for neural machine translation . The first is the source-side monolingual data. Second, is the target-side monolingual data that is used as back-translation data. Both datasets are translated by a teacher model from source-language to target-language, which are then combined into a dataset for smaller student models.  We find that source-side monolingual data improves model performance when evaluated by test-set originated from source-side. Likewise, target-side data has a positive effect on the test-set in the opposite direction. We also show that it is not required to train the student model with the same data used by the teacher, as long as the domains are the same. Finally, we find that combining source-side and target-side yields in better performance than relying on just one side of the monolingual data."

Recent years has witnessed the great success of end-to-end neural machine translation  models, which has dominated the mainstream approach in commercial machine translation systems. In this work, we first provide a broad review of the methods and challenges in NMT. We introduce three basic components in NMT methods, namely modeling, inference, and learning. The modeling part starts with the encoder-decoder framework and the celebrated attention mechanism, which is followed by Recurrent Neural Networks , Convolutional Neural Networks , and Self-Attention Networks  as potential instances in an NMT architecture.

"NMT task transforming source sequence new form particular target language using deep neural networks. Such networks commonly encoder-decoder architecture , encoder maps given input sequence intermediate representation decoder uses representation generate candidate translations. Both encoder decoder neural networks trained jointly.

Recently, Transformers shown promising results NMT become new standard field. They follow concept encoding decoding relatively different fashion. A Transformer fundamentally feed-forward model unique neural components alter traditional translation pipeline accordingly. Therefore, expected model behaves differently recurrent convolutional counterparts. Our goal research study aspect presence noise.

This article reviewed widely used methods NMT, including modeling, decoding, data augmentation, interpretation, well evaluation. We summarize resources tools useful NMT research. Despite great success achieved NMT, still many problems explored. We list important challenging problems NMT follows:"," Transformers \cite{transformer} have brought a remarkable improvement in the performance of neural machine translation  systems, but they could be surprisingly vulnerable to noise. Accordingly, we tried to investigate how noise breaks Transformers and if there exist solutions to deal with such issues. There is a large body of work in the NMT literature on analyzing the behaviour of conventional models for the problem of noise but it seems Transformers are understudied in this context.  Therefore, we introduce a novel data-driven technique to incorporate noise during training. This idea is comparable to the well-known fine-tuning strategy. Moreover, we propose two new extensions to the original Transformer, that modify the neural architecture as well as the training process to handle noise. We evaluated our techniques to translate the English--German pair in both directions. Experimental results show that our models have a higher tolerance to noise. More specifically, they perform with no deterioration where up to $10$\% of entire test words are infected by noise."
"Cross-lingual word embeddings represent words two languages shared space, semantically similar words different languages close other. Early work focused jointly learning CLWEs two languages, relying strong cross-lingual supervision form parallel corpora bilingual dictionaries . However, approaches later superseded offline mapping methods, separately train word embeddings different languages align unsupervised manner self-learning adversarial training . Despite advantage requiring parallel resources, mapping methods critically rely underlying embeddings similar structure, known isometry assumption. Several authors observed assumption generally hold, severely hindering performance methods . In later work, \citet{ormazabal-etal-2019-analyzing} showed issue arises trying align separately trained embeddings, joint learning methods susceptible it. In paper, propose alternative approach limitation, still work without parallel resources. The core idea method fix target language embeddings, learn aligned embeddings source language scratch. This prevents structural mismatches result independently training embeddings different languages, learning source embeddings tailored particular set target embeddings. For purpose, use extension skip-gram leverages translated context words anchor points. So translate context words, start weak initial dictionary, iteratively improved self-learning, incorporate restarting procedure make method robust.

We also interested studying noise classes. We could afford work one class selected natural noise find realistic among others, work extended noise classes. Finally, models unique Transformer NMT. We aim evaluate language processing/understanding tasks.","  Recent research on cross-lingual word embeddings has been dominated by unsupervised mapping approaches that align monolingual embeddings. Such methods critically rely on those embeddings having a similar structure, but it was recently shown that the separate training in different languages causes departures from this assumption. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach that does not have this limitation, while requiring a weak seed dictionary  as the only form of supervision. Rather than aligning two fixed embedding spaces, our method works by fixing the target language embeddings, and learning a new set of embeddings for the source language that are aligned with them. To that end, we use an extension of skip-gram that leverages translated context words as anchor points, and incorporates self-learning and iterative restarts to reduce the dependency on the initial dictionary. Our approach outperforms conventional mapping methods on bilingual lexicon induction, and obtains competitive results in the downstream XNLI task."
"Supervised semi-supervised Machine Learning algorithms ubiquitous analysis social media data. At core algorithms ability make sense vast amount semi-structured real-time data streams, allowing automatically categorize filter new data examples into, usually pre-defined, classes. Multi-class text classification successfully used public health surveillance, election monitoring, vaccine stance prediction~\parencite{salathe2011assessing,bermingham2011using,brownstein2009digital}. In recent years algorithms also developed mitigate negative effects social media, detection cyber-bullying, hate speech, misinformation, automated accounts ~\parencite{reynolds2011using,davidson2017automated,shu2017fake,davis2016botornot}. The microblogging service Twitter played central role efforts, serves public medium provides easy access real-time data public APIs, making primary focus work. Twitter well described classical example non-stationary system frequently emerging disappearing topical clusters~\parencite{costa2014concept}. This poses problems aforementioned applications, underlying data distribution different training time time algorithm's application real world. This phenomenon known concept drift~\parencite{schlimmer1986incremental} lead change performance algorithm time. It important distinguish concept drift reasons performance differences training testing, random noise due sampling biases differences data preprocessing~\parencite{vzliobaite2010learning,webb2016characterizing}. A classic example concept drift change meaning classes, requires update learned class decision boundaries classifier. This sometimes also referred real concept drift. Often, however, observed performance change consequence change underlying data distribution, leading known virtual drift~\parencite{widmer1996learning,tsymbal2004problem}. Virtual drift overcome supplemental learning, i.e.\ collecting training data new environment. A good example periodic seasonality effects, may fully represented initial training data become fully visible time. However, practice usually difficult disentangle virtual real concept drift, consequence treated effect~\parencite{vzliobaite2010learning}. On Twitter concept drift might appear different time scales different rates. Sudden shifts debate might triggered quickly evolving news cycle catastrophic event. Concept drift may also slow process way topic discussed gradually changes time. A substantial amount work dedicated detecting overcoming concept drift~\parencite{widmer1996learning,vzliobaite2010learning,elwell2011incremental}. Three basic re-training procedures overcoming concept drift proposed: time-window approach, incremental model, ensemble model~\parencite{costa2014concept}. In time-window approach, sliding window recent training examples used train algorithm. In approach, algorithm ignores training data collected outside time window. The incremental model, contrast, uses previously collected training examples re-train model. Lastly, ensemble model trains model time window uses consensus previous models future predictions. As found in~\parencite{costa2014concept}, case hashtag prediction Twitter data, incremental method gave best results. Although sophisticated methods proposed estimate concept drift unsupervised way~\parencite{katakis2010tracking,yang2008conceptual}, practice, certain amount re-annotation detection re-training models seems unavoidable. The decision newly collected data annotate points exploration-exploitation dilemma, usually addressed context active learning framework~\parencite{settles2009active}. The Crowdbreaks platform~\parencite{muller2019crowdbreaks} example framework built goal exploring optimal solutions problem order overcome concept drift. A change underlying data distribution might necessarily negative impact classifier performance. It conceivable, example, polarisation debate Twitter topic could even lead improvement classifier performance. It therefore important ask much worried concept drift: even model performance decrease, real impacts analysis interpretation might negligible. The consequences concept drift task-, environment-, model-dependent~\parencite{vzliobaite2016overview}. Here, address concept drift specific case vaccine stance classification. Vaccine stance classification Twitter data widely studied shown promising links vaccination decision making vaccine uptake rates different countries~\parencite{salathe2011assessing,bello2017detecting}. The COVID-19 pandemic emphasizes importance, evolving concerns vaccines may significantly influence effect~\parencite{johnson2020online,burki2020online}. To best knowledge, one study directly addressed concept drift vaccine stance classification. In study~\parencite{d2019monitoring} tweets posted September 2016 January 2017 Italian language, authors find substantial improvement model incremental re-training specific events. Re-training performed 60 newly annotated tweets seven manually selected events. The authors conclude either original algorithm already quite robust towards concept change, newly collected training data small see effect. Here, use FastText~\parencite{joulin2016bag} BERT ~\parencite{devlin2018bert}, two commonly used models social media text classification. Most work topic concept drift conducted using classical machine learning models, also FastText belongs. These types models reliant high-quality annotation data. More recently, models transformer family, BERT~\parencite{devlin2018bert}, proposed, require significantly less annotation data. In follows, examine whether two models also share different concept drift characteristics. The goal work emulate typical social media analysis study, data collected certain period time, supervised machine learning model trained subset annotated data. The model published used predict newly collected data. First, try answer whether concept drift observed, so, rate occurs. Second, investigate influence study duration amount annotation data used. Lastly, examine extent concept drift influences final analysis outcomes, case sentiment index. {\small } \clearpage","   Social media analysis has become a common approach to assess public opinion on various topics, including those about health, in near real-time.   The growing volume of social media posts has led to an increased usage of modern machine learning methods in natural language processing.   While the rapid dynamics of social media can capture underlying trends quickly, it also poses a technical problem: algorithms trained on annotated data in the past may underperform when applied to contemporary data.   This phenomenon, known as concept drift, can be particularly problematic when rapid shifts occur either in the topic of interest itself, or in the way the topic is discussed.   Here, we explore the effect of machine learning concept drift by focussing on vaccine sentiments expressed on Twitter, a topic of central importance especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.   We show that while vaccine sentiment has declined considerably during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, algorithms trained on pre-pandemic data would have largely missed this decline due to concept drift.   Our results suggest that social media analysis systems must address concept drift in a continuous fashion in order to avoid the risk of systematic misclassification of data, which is particularly likely during a crisis when the underlying data can change suddenly and rapidly."

Using vaccine-related dataset 2018--2020, demonstrate failing take concept drift account would largely missed rather dramatic decay vaccine sentiment COVID-19 pandemic 2020. We find overall, concept drift indeed occurred, led decline model performance 20\ course three years. However, decline happened ten months. Concept drift therefore affected model performance different rates throughout observation period. Furthermore, relative performance loss consistently negative reverted initial levels, even slightly that. These findings consistent various ways real virtual concept drift occur. Although BERT models yielded higher performance scores, immune issues related concept drift. On relative scale, BERT models show degree drift much less sophisticated FastText models. In order better understand reasons phenomena, investigate properties used datasets. We explain large differences initial performance models differences semantic ambiguity text, indicated low inter-annotator agreement low corpus variability. Occurrence concept drift could linked differences corpus similarity. In particular, find negative class responsible decay performance time also shows strongest signs drift. Anti-vaccine content may therefore change topics increased rate compared positive neutral content. A caveat study results based classifiers mediocre performance. Given fact negative class affected concept drift time also smallest class dataset, fair question ask whether concept drift would disappear given annotation data higher performance models. It conceivable annotation data would lead better representation training window. However, results study automated geo-location tweets show, concept drift still occur also vast amounts annotated data adaptive re-training even relatively small corpus overcome drift. Our results overlap previous study vaccination-related Twitter data, find concept drift observation period September 2016 January 2017 Italian language. The reason could time scale analysed small see effect, concept drift much smaller particular dataset. It safe assume COVID-19 pandemic led severe topical shifts vaccine debate, ultimately translated strong concept drift model performance loss. Based results, expected future crisis situations would lead similarly strong concept drift, thereby severely undermining utility social media monitoring tools take concept drift account. This especially true applications intended used exactly circumstances. Although work focused singular task vaccine stance prediction, believe results stress general importance addressing concept drift real-time social media monitoring project. Overcoming concept drift complex task, many algorithmic solutions proposed. However, order succeed practice, tightly coordinated fine-tuned framework annotation retraining models required.

We propose a multi-label active learning screening specific sampling technique -objective-aware sampling- for querying unlabelled documents for annotating. Our algorithm takes a decision on which machine filter need more training data and how to choose unlabeled items to annotate in order to minimize the risk of overall classification errors rather than minimizing a single filter error.

Much of the existing progress in multimodal learning, however, focuses primarily on problems where the same set of modalities are present at train and test time, which makes learning in low-resource modalities particularly difficult. In this work, we propose algorithms for cross-modal generalization: a learning paradigm to train a model that can  quickly perform new tasks in a target modality  and  doing so while being trained on a different source modality. We study a key research question: how can we ensure generalization across modalities despite using separate encoders for different source and target modalities? Our solution is based on meta-alignment, a novel method to align representation spaces using strongly and weakly paired cross-modal data while ensuring quick generalization to new tasks across different modalities. We study this problem on 3 classification tasks: text to image, image to audio, and text to speech. Our results demonstrate strong performance even when the new target modality has only a few  labeled samples and in the presence of noisy labels, a scenario particularly prevalent in low-resource modalities. %Despite vast differences in these raw modalities, humans seamlessly perceive multimodal data, learn new concepts, and show extraordinary capabilities in generalizing across input modalities. %In addition, our method works particularly well when the target modality suffers from noisy or limited labels, a scenario particularly prevalent in low-resource modalities. %, sometimes outperforming within modality few-shot baselines that have seen thousands of labeled examples from that target modality during meta-training. %\zing[Ziyin: heterogeneous -> multimodal? since we are assuming there is an underlying shared space, so maybe not heterogeneous] %\zing[Ziyin: since this is the first sentence in the intro, maybe remove this?] %Similarly, truly general artificial intelligence  systems must learn to generalize across multiple input modalities and output tasks. %In this work, we define and propose algorithms for a new notion of generalization:  %, languages, and concepts. %We believe that our proposed methods could open new doors towards better generalization in multimodal AI systems."

Our experiments demonstrate strong performance classifying data entirely new target modality limited samples noisy labels, particularly useful generalization low-resource images, speech, languages. \iffalse","   As cloud services are growing and generating high revenues, the cost of downtime in these services is becoming significantly expensive. To reduce loss and service downtime, a critical primary step is to execute incident triage, the process of assigning a service incident to the correct responsible team, in a timely manner. An incorrect assignment risks additional incident reroutings and increases its time to mitigate by 10x. However, automated incident triage in large cloud services faces many challenges:  a highly imbalanced incident distribution from a large number of teams,    wide variety in formats of input data or data sources,     scaling to meet production-grade requirements, and     gaining engineers' trust in using machine learning recommendations.    To address these challenges, we introduce {\TransferAssistant}, an intelligent incident transfer service combining multiple machine learning techniques -- gradient boosted classifiers, clustering methods, and deep neural networks -- in an ensemble to recommend the responsible team to triage an incident. Experimental results on real incidents in Microsoft Azure show that our service achieves $82.9\%$ F1 score. For highly impacted incidents, {\TransferAssistant} achieves F1 score from $76.3\% - 91.3\%$. We have applied best practices and state-of-the-art frameworks to scale {\TransferAssistant} to handle incident routing for all cloud services. {\TransferAssistant} has been deployed in Azure since October 2017 and is used by thousands of teams daily."

Topics discovered even small number inquiries present, generally specific, thus enabling targeted, informed decisions medical experts. Being completely unsupervised, algorithm discover topics neither known expected advance, topics often valuable.

This however burdensome inspection limited inquiries associated given topic .

The hope stimulate mining medical inquiries, generally use natural language processing unsupervised learning medical industry. Interesting future directions inclusion priori expert knowledge time maintaining ability discover new previously unknown topics, grouping topics meta-topics though clustering hierarchy. \section{Methods} Since dataset comprises real-word medical inquiries, preprocessing crucial step limit amount noise corpus. acronyms The corpus contains numerous acronyms: first step thus acronym resolution, i.e. substitute given acronym extended form. A dictionary recurring acronyms compiled help medical experts. Acronym resolution performed via curated dictionary two reasons. First, data scarce noisy train reliable, custom-made word embedding learn acronym meanings corpus. Second, pretrained word embeddings typically suitable representation acronym, acronym corpus used indicate something different natural language . For example, corpus lode refer vein metal, stands lack product effect. Regular expressions used remove non-informative strings . Next. text split sentences, tokenized lemmatized using scispaCy library . We disable scispaCy parser; gives significant speed-up without affecting topic discovery outcome. Finally stopwords removed. In addition standard English stopwords, non-standard stopwords arise dataset composed medical inquiries e.g. ask, request, email, inquiry, patient, doctor, product-dependent stopwords, typically brand chemical name medicinal product inquiries refer to. It also case medical inquiry corpus single words bear value, combined longer relevant medical topic discovery. For example, word years old generally relevance, contiguous longer significant since expression simply originates medical information specialists logging age patient inquiry refers to. Another example word morning: appearing alone relevance, preceded word good loses relevance since expression good morning bear significance medical topic discovery. We compile short list stop n-grams remove corpus. To represent medical inquiries, scispaCy word embedding model en\_core\_sci\_lg-0.2.5 used. No model re-training fine-tuning performed small amount data sparsity problem; since labels available, one would need train language model noisy short text instances would likely lead model forget semantics learned scispaCy model. For token, scispaCy embedding vector retrieved; sentence representation obtained simply calculating arithmetic average vectors representing token tokens belonging given sentence. Even though overwhelming majority out-of-vocabulary words interest medical topic discovery, small subset important oov words would missed one simply use word2vec model. We thus devise strategy overcome this, described below. For product, recurring oov words automatically detected; words need included word2vec model represented vector accurately captures meaning. Training new embedding include new terms good approach given sparseness problem described above. To overcome this, combine definition mapping embedding strategy. definition mapping out-of-vocabulary words Specifically, first relevant oov terms manually mapped short definition; example, oov ReDOS mapped dose optimization study since ReDOS refers dose-optimisation phase 2 study regorafenib . definition embedding Then, using text definitions, meaningful vector representation oov words obtained embedding strategy described . This procedure two main benefits. First, require training data training effort. Second, ensures construction added word vectors compatible word representation model use. Pharmaceutical product trade names oov words particular interest medical topic discovery. Indeed, able take consideration drug trade names importance since substantial amount questions mention instance drug interactions. However, generally included scispaCy model. Thus, slightly different procedure used ensure trade names appearing medical inquiries added model, regardless belonging recurring oov words not. Luckily, international non-proprietary names drugs included. For instance, oncology product trade name Stivarga\texttrademark\ present, corresponding INN is. Thus, automatically detect drug trade names utilize scispaCy named entity recognizer scispaCy UmlsEntityLinker follows. First, NER used extract entities text; then, entity, UmlsEntityLinker performs linking Unified Medical Language System searching within knowledge base approximately 2.7 million concepts via string overlap described Ref. \onlinecite{neumann-2019}. To limit number false positive matches increase UmlsEntityLinker threshold 0.85 default 0.7. For entities successfully linked UMLS, several information regarding identified concepts returned UmlsEntityLinker: concept unique identifier , concept preferred name, concept definition, concept aliases, concept type unique identifier . In particular, latter defines semantic group linked concept belongs ; up-to-date list semantic type mappings found . A TUI value T121 indicates concept found Pharmacologic Substance. Extracting entities TUI equal T121 allows automatically identify drug trade names. Each drug trade name mapped concept preferred name; present, concept definition used; also present, drug trade name replaced phrase pharmaceutical medication drug. Once mapping performed, embedding strategy used oov words followed order obtain semantically meaningful word vector representations. The HDBSCAN algorithm starts defining mutual reachability distance based density estimation; data represented weighted graph vertices data points edges weight equal mutual reachability distance points. The minimum spanning tree built, converted hierarchy connected components via union-find data structure: starting initial cluster containing points, data subsequently split level hierarchy according distance, ultimately returning many clusters data points threshold distance approaches zero. This cluster hierarchy commonly depicted dendogram. To obtain meaningful set clusters, hierarchy needs condensed. The crucial point discern - given split - two new meaningful clusters formed splitting parent cluster, instead parent cluster simply loosing points . In HDBSCAN, decision governed minimum cluster size hyper-parameter : cluster split accepted newly formed clusters least min\_cluster\_size points. The final clusters chosen set condensed clusters means measure stability defined Ref. \onlinecite{campello-2013}. define hyperparameters The main factor defining min\_cluster\_size number inquiries given product: want obtain 100 clusters results easily analyzed medical experts. It important point min\_cluster\_size strictly specify number clusters formed, rather provides algorithm indication regarding desired granularity, outlined above. In case, min\_cluster\_size ranges 5 10 depending number inquiries. This small range variation substantially facilitate hyper-parameter search. Moreover, noticed - approximately amount inquiries min\_cluster\_size - number returned clusters increases data variety, data variety qualitatively evaluated manual inspection: products diverse inquiries HDBSCAN tends return higher number clusters, ceteris paribus. ceteris paribus means things equal We utilize leaf cluster selection method instead excess mass algorithm former known return homogeneous clusters . use soft clustering Due noise dataset, using standard HDBSCAN clustering results large portion dataset considered outliers consistently across products. To overcome this, use soft HDBSCAN clustering, returns - instead cluster assignment - probability inquiry belongs given cluster. We define probability threshold point considered outlier; points threshold, associate cluster highest probability argmax operation. This probability threshold ranges chosen approximately 10\ inquiries classified outliers. As mentioned main text, computational reasons, project via UMAP lower dimensional space clustering performed. Specifically, project 100 dimensions products less 15,000 inquiries, 20 dimensions products 15,000 inquiries. Moreover, inquiries longer 800 characters also considered outliers: text representation degrades long sentences. These inquiries gathered outlier cluster made available medical experts manual inspection. Given topic, vector representation word topic name calculated; topic name vector obtained averaging word vectors words present topic name. Topics merged similarity - evaluated cosine similarity topic name vectors - larger threshold. Threshold values range 0.8 0.95 depending medicinal product considered. The popular topic evaluation metrics topic modelling long text UCI UMass . However, UCI UMass metrics good indicators quality topics short text topic modelling due sparseness problem. In Ref. \onlinecite{quan-2015}, purity measure introduced evaluate short text topic modelling; however, requires pairs short long documents , thus applicable long document associated given medical inquiry. Indeed, evaluation short text topic modelling open research problem . An additional challenge absence labels. Performing annotations would require substantial manual effort specialized medical professionals, would limited use one main goals discover previously unknown topics new inquiries received. The absence labels precludes use metrics based purity normalized mutual information proposed Ref. \onlinecite{rosenberg-2007}, \onlinecite{huang-2013}, \onlinecite{yin-2014}. distributional semantic Ref. \onlinecite{aletras-2013} bring forward valuable idea using distributional semantic evaluate topic coherence, exploiting semantic similarity learned word2vec models. Topic coherence assessed calculating similarity among top n-words given topic: semantically similar top n-words lead higher topic coherence. If might general desirable, case discovering medical topics actually detrimental: interesting topics often characterized top n-words semantically similar. For example, medical topic top 2-words rivaroxaban glutine clearly relevant medical topic discovery standpoint. However, rivaroxaban glutine semantically similar, thus metric proposed Ref. \onlinecite{aletras-2013} would consider low coherence topic, stark contrast human expert judgment. Analogous considerations apply indirect confirmation measures Ref. \onlinecite{roeder-2015}: words emerging novel topics would rarely appeared shared context. For reason, introduce new measure topic compactness takes account semantics inquiries, require labeled data. Specifically, compute similarity inquiries belonging given topic , sum elements resulting similarity matrix, divide total number elements matrix. The topic semantic compactness topic reads cardinality topic , word vector representing inquiry , function quantifying semantic similarity inquiry , taking values 0 1 . Given chosen normalization factor , thus directly used topic quality score. The topic compactness maximum attained every sentence contains exactly words. It important point automatically takes semantics account: different semantically similar medical inquiries would still high similarity score, thus would lead high topic semantic compactness, despite inquiries using different words express similar content. add example glutine Contrary Ref. \onlinecite{aletras-2013}, topic semantic compactness introduced Eq. artificially penalize novel topics associate semantically different words appearing inquiry. To come back previous example, numerous inquiries discovered topic contain words rivaroxaban glutine, topic semantic compactness would high , regardless fact top 2-words semantically similar since similarity evaluated inquiry level . It also beneficial evaluate representative topic name topic represents. To end, calculate name saliency medical topic calculating similarity word vector representing topic name word vectors representing inquiries topic, sum similarity values, divide total number inquiries topic. This reads cardinality topic , word vector representing name topic , vector representing inquiry . This returns score quantifies representative name topic represents. As case topic semantic compactness, name saliency takes natively semantics account via Eq. . In Eq. Eq. , cosine similarity used similarity measure. \section{Competing interests} Financial support research provided Bayer AG.

Conventional textual-based causality knowledge acquisition methods typically require laborious and expensive human annotations. As a result, their scale is often limited. Moreover, as no context is provided during the annotation, the resulting causality knowledge records  typically do not take the context into consideration. To explore a more scalable way of acquiring causality knowledge, in this paper, we jump out of the textual domain and investigate the possibility of learning contextual causality from the visual signal. Compared with pure text-based approaches, learning causality from the visual signal has the following advantages:  Causality knowledge belongs to the commonsense knowledge, which is rarely expressed in the text but rich in videos;  Most events in the video are naturally time-ordered, which provides a rich resource for us to mine causality knowledge from;  All the objects in the video can be used as context to study the contextual property of causal relations. In detail, we first propose a high-quality dataset Vis-Causal and then conduct experiments to demonstrate that with good language and visual representation models as well as enough training signals, it is possible to automatically discover meaningful causal knowledge from the videos. Further analysis also shows that the contextual property of causal relations indeed exists, taking which into consideration might be crucial if we want to use the causality knowledge in real applications, and the visual signal could serve as a good resource for learning such contextual causality. Vis-Causal and all used codes are available at: \url{https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/Vis_Causal}. % In detail, we first identify events from the videos, which are represented with natural sentences, and then leverage the visual signal to predict the contextual causal relations among these events.     % In this work, we mimic how human beings learn causality and explore the possibility of acquiring causality knowledge with visual signal. % To do so, we first define the task of mining contextual causality knowledge from visual signals, which aims at evaluating models' abilities to identify causal relation given certain visual context, and then employ the crowd-sourcing to annotate a high-quality dataset Vis-Causal. % On top of that, we propose a Vision-Contextual Causal  model that can utilize the images as context to better acquire causality knowledge. % Different from existing \revisehm{causality knowledge acquisition works}, \revisehm{to the best of our knowledge, }the proposed solution \revisehm{is the first one that }has the potential to preserve contextual property  of causal relations."

Conventional speech recognition systems comprise a large number of discrete   components such as an acoustic model, a language model, a pronunciation model,    a text-normalizer, an inverse-text normalizer, a decoder based on a Weighted Finite State   Transducer , and so on. To obtain sufficiently high speech recognition   accuracy  with such conventional speech recognition systems, a very large   language model  is usually needed.

Examples include speech recognition systems based on  Connectionist Temporal Classification , Recurrent Neural Network Transducer , Attention-based Encoder-Decoder models , Monotonic   Chunk-wise Attention ,    transformer-based speech recognition systems, and so on. These fully neural   network-based systems require much smaller memory footprints compared to   conventional algorithms, therefore their on-device implementation has become   feasible. In this paper, we review such end-to-end speech recognition models.   We extensively discuss their structures, performance, and advantages compared   to conventional algorithms."

We propose a two-stage learning framework that combines self-supervised learning and cross-lingual knowledge transfer. The framework consists of autoregressive predictive coding  as the front-end and a cross-lingual deep neural network  as the back-end.

APC pretraining brings improvement to the entire framework, and brings larger improvement with increased amount of training data. Our best performance achieved by using unlabeled training data without linguistic knowledge of the target language is very close to that of a supervised system trained with labeled data of that language. The back-end of our approach is found more effective than a cross-lingual AM based BNF in cross-lingual knowledge transfer. Experiments on the ABX subword discriminability task conducted with the Libri-light and ZeroSpeech 2017 databases showed that our approach is competitive or superior to state-of-the-art studies.  % A comprehensive and systematic analysis at the phoneme- and articulatory feature - level is carried out to investigate the type of information that is captured by our learned feature representation. New metrics are proposed for the phoneme-level ABX subword discriminability task and attribute-level ABX AF task. The phoneme-level analysis showed that compared to MFCC, our approach achieves larger improvement in capturing diphthong information than monophthong vowel information, and the improvement varies greatly to different consonants. Results found there is a positive correlation between the effectiveness of the back-end in capturing a phoneme's information and the quality of cross-lingual phone labels assigned to that phoneme. The AF-level analysis showed that the proposed approach is better than MFCC and APC features in capturing manner of articulation , place of articulation , vowel height and backness information. Results indicate MoA is better captured by the proposed approach than PoA, and both MoA and PoA are better captured than vowel height and backness. Results implies AF information is less language-dependent than phoneme information.   Comprehensive and systematic analyses at the phoneme- and articulatory feature -level showed that our approach was better at capturing diphthong than monophthong vowel information, while also differences in the amount of information captured for different types of consonants were observed. Moreover, a positive correlation was found between the effectiveness of the back-end in capturing a phoneme's information and the quality of the cross-lingual phone labels assigned to the phoneme. The AF-level analysis together with t-SNE visualization results showed that the proposed approach is better than MFCC and APC features in capturing manner and place of articulation information, vowel height, and backness information.  % Taking all the analyses together, the two stages in our approach are both effective in capturing phoneme information. Monophthong vowel information is much more difficult to be captured than consonant information, which suggests a future research direction to improve the effectiveness of capturing monophthong vowel information.  Taken together, the analyses showed that the two stages in our approach are both effective in capturing phoneme and AF information. Nevertheless, monophthong vowel information is less well captured than consonant information, which suggests that future research should focus on improving capturing monophthong vowel information."
